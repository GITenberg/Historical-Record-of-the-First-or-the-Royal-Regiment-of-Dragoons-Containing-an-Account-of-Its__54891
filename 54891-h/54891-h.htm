<h2 class="lsp">PREFACE.</h2>
<p class="p4" />

<p class="noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must chiefly
depend upon the zeal and ardour, by which all who enter
into its service are animated, and consequently it is of the
highest importance that any measure calculated to excite the
spirit of emulation, by which alone great and gallant actions
are achieved, should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment of this
desirable object, than a full display of the noble deeds with
which the Military History of our country abounds. To hold
forth these bright examples to the imitation of the youthful
soldier, and thus to incite him to emulate the meritorious
conduct of those who have preceded him in their honourable
career, are among the motives that have given rise to the
present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed, announced
in the 'London Gazette,' from whence they are transferred
into the public prints: the achievements of our armies are thus
made known at the time of their occurrence, and receive the
tribute of praise and admiration to which they are entitled.
On extraordinary occasions, the Houses of Parliament have
been in the habit of conferring on the Commanders, and the
Officers and Troops acting under their orders, expressions of
approbation and of thanks for their skill and bravery, and these
testimonials, confirmed by the high honour of their Sovereign's
Approbation, constitute the reward which the soldier most
highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice (which
appears to have long prevailed in some of the Continental
armies) for British Regiments to keep regular records of their
services and achievements. Hence some difficulty has been
experienced in obtaining, particularly from the old Regiments,
an authentic account of their origin and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence of His
Majesty having been pleased to command, that every Regiment
shall in future keep a full and ample record of its services at
home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country will henceforth
derive information as to the difficulties and privations
which chequer the career of those who embrace the military
profession. In Great Britain, where so large a number of
persons are devoted to the active concerns of agriculture,
manufactures, and commerce, and where these pursuits have,
for so long a period, been undisturbed by the <em>presence of war</em>,
which few other countries have escaped, comparatively little
is known of the vicissitudes of active service, and of the
casualties of climate, to which, even during peace, the British
Troops are exposed in every part of the globe, with little or
no interval of repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which the
country derives from the industry and the enterprise of the agriculturist
and the trader, its happy inhabitants may be supposed
not often to reflect on the perilous duties of the soldier and
the sailor,&mdash;on their sufferings,&mdash;and on the sacrifice of valuable
life, by which so many national benefits are obtained
and preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour, and endurance,
have shone conspicuously under great and trying difficulties;
and their character has been established in Continental
warfare by the irresistible spirit with which they have effected
debarkations in spite of the most formidable opposition, and
by the gallantry and steadiness with which they have maintained
their advantages against superior numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to the gallant exertions
of the Corps employed; but the details of their services, and
of acts of individual bravery, can only be fully given in the
Annals of the various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication, under
His Majesty's special authority, by Mr. <span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>,
Principal Clerk of the Adjutant-General's Office; and while
the perusal of them cannot fail to be useful and interesting to
military men of every rank, it is considered that they will also
afford entertainment and information to the general reader,
particularly to those who may have served in the Army, or
who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who have served,
or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit de Corps</i>&mdash;an attachment
to every thing belonging to their Regiment; to such
persons a narrative of the services of their own Corps cannot
fail to prove interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions
of the great,&mdash;the valiant,&mdash;the loyal, have always been of
paramount interest with a brave and civilised people. Great
Britain has produced a race of heroes who, in moments of
danger and terror, have stood, "firm as the rocks of their
native shore;" and when half the World has been arrayed
against them, they have fought the battles of their Country
with unshaken fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,&mdash;victories so complete and surprising,
gained by our countrymen,&mdash;our brothers&mdash;our fellow-citizens
in arms,&mdash;a record which revives the memory of the brave,
and brings their gallant deeds before us, will certainly prove
acceptable to the public.</p>

<p>Biographical memoirs of the Colonels and other distinguished
Officers, will be introduced in the Records of their respective
Regiments, and the Honorary Distinctions which have, from
time to time, been conferred upon each Regiment, as testifying
the value and importance of its services, will be faithfully
set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record of each
Regiment will be printed in a distinct number, so that when
the whole shall be completed, the Parts may be bound up in
numerical succession.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<hr class="r20" />

<p class="noindent">The ancient Armies of England were composed
of Horse and Foot; but the feudal troops established
by William the Conqueror in 1086, consisted
almost entirely of Horse. Under the feudal
system, every holder of land amounting to what
was termed a "knight's fee," was required to
provide a charger, a coat of mail, a helmet, a
shield, and a lance, and to serve the Crown a
period of forty days in each year at his own
expense; and the great landholders had to provide
armed men in proportion to the extent of
their estates; consequently the ranks of the feudal
Cavalry were completed with men of property,
and the vassals and tenants of the great barons,
who led their dependents to the field in person.</p>

<p>In the succeeding reigns the Cavalry of the
Army was composed of Knights (or men at arms)
and Hobiliers (or horsemen of inferior degree);
and the Infantry of spear and battle-axe men,
cross-bowmen, and archers. The Knights wore
armour on every part of the body, and their
weapons were a lance, a sword, and a small
dagger. The Hobiliers were accoutred and armed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[ii]</a></span>
for the light and less important services of war,
and were not considered qualified for a charge in
line. Mounted Archers<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> were also introduced,
and the English nation eventually became pre-eminent
in the use of the bow.</p>

<p>About the time of Queen Mary the appellation
of "<em>Men at Arms</em>" was changed to that of "<em>Spears</em>
and <em>Launces</em>." The introduction of fire-arms ultimately
occasioned the lance to fall into disuse,
and the title of the Horsemen of the first degree
was changed to "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cuirassiers</i>." The Cuirassiers
were armed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cap-à-pié</i>, and their weapons were a
sword with a straight narrow blade and sharp
point, and a pair of large pistols, called petrenels;
and the Hobiliers carried carbines. The Infantry
carried pikes, matchlocks, and swords. The
introduction of fire-arms occasioned the formation
of regiments armed and equipped as infantry,
but mounted on small horses for the sake of
expedition of movement, and these were styled
"<em>Dragoons</em>;" a small portion of the military
force of the kingdom, however, consisted of this
description of troops.</p>

<p>The formation of the present Army commenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[iii]</a></span>
after the Restoration in 1660, with the establishment
of regular corps of Horse and Foot; the
Horsemen were cuirassiers, but only wore armour
on the head and body; and the Foot were pikemen
and musketeers. The arms which each
description of force carried, are described in the
following extract from the "Regulations of King
Charles II.," dated 5th May, 1663:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Each Horseman to have for his defensive
armes, back, breast, and pot; and for his offensive
armes, a sword, and a case of pistolls, the
barrels whereof are not to be und<sup>r</sup>. foorteen
inches in length; and each Trooper of Our
Guards to have a carbine, besides the aforesaid
armes. And the Foote to have each souldier a
sword, and each pikeman a pike of 16 foote
long and not und<sup>r</sup>.; and each musqueteer a
musquet, with a collar of bandaliers, the barrels
of which musquet to be about foor foote long,
and to conteine a bullet, foorteen of which shall
weigh a pound weight<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>."</p></div>

<p>The ranks of the Troops of Horse were at this
period composed of men of some property&mdash;generally
the sons of substantial yeomen: the young
men received as recruits provided their own horses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
and they were placed on a rate of pay sufficient
to give them a respectable station in society.</p>

<p>On the breaking out of the war with Holland,
in the spring of 1672, a Regiment of Dragoons
was raised<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>; the Dragoons were placed on a lower
rate of pay than the Horse; and the Regiment
was armed similar to the Infantry, excepting that
a limited number of the men carried halberds
instead of pikes, and the others muskets and bayonets;
and a few men in each Troop had pistols;
as appears by a warrant dated the 2nd of April,
1672, of which the following is an extract:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Charles R.</span></p>

<p class="in3">"Our will and pleasure is, that a Regiment
of Dragoones which we have established
and ordered to be raised, in twelve Troopes of
fourscore in each beside officers, who are to be
under the command of Our most deare and most
intirely beloved Cousin Prince Rupert, shall
be armed out of Our stoares remaining within
Our office of the Ordinance, as followeth; that
is to say, three corporalls, two serjeants, the
gentlemen at armes, and twelve souldiers of
each of the said twelve Troopes, are to have and
carry each of them one halbard, and one case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
of pistolls with holsters; and the rest of the
souldiers of the several Troopes aforesaid, are
to have and to carry each of them one matchlocke
musquet, with a collar of bandaliers, and
also to have and to carry one bayonet<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, or great
knife. That each lieutenant have and carry
one partizan; and that two drums be delivered
out for each Troope of the said Regiment<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>."</p></div>

<p>Several regiments of Horse and Dragoons were
raised in the first year of the reign of King
James II.; and the horsemen carried a short carbine<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
in addition to the sword and pair of pistols;
and in a Regulation dated the 21st of February,
1687, the arms of the Dragoons at that period are
commanded to be as follow:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Dragoons to have snaphanse musquets,
strapt, with bright barrels of three foote eight
inches long, cartouch-boxes, bayonetts, granado
pouches, bucketts, and hammer-hatchetts."</p></div>

<p>After several years' experience, little advantage
was found to accrue from having Cavalry Regiments
formed almost exclusively for engaging the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>enemy on foot; and, the Horse having laid aside
their armour, the arms and equipment of Horse
and Dragoons were so nearly assimilated, that
there remained little distinction besides the name
and rate of pay. The introduction of improvements
into the mounting, arming, and equipment
of Dragoons rendered them competent to the
performance of every description of service required
of Cavalry; and, while the long musket
and bayonet were retained, to enable them to act
as Infantry, if necessary, they were found to be
equally efficient, and of equal value to the nation,
as Cavalry, with the Regiments of Horse.</p>

<p>In the several augmentations made to the
regular Army after the early part of the reign of
Queen Anne, no new Regiments of Horse were
raised for permanent service; and in 1746 King
George II. reduced three of the old Regiments
of Horse to the quality and pay of Dragoons; at
the same time, His Majesty gave them the title of
First, Second, and Third Regiments of <em>Dragoon
Guards</em>: and in 1788 the same alteration was
made in the remaining four Regiments of Horse,
which then became the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and
Seventh Regiments of <em>Dragoon Guards</em>.</p>

<p>At present there are only three Regiments
which are styled <em>Horse</em> in the British Army,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
namely, the two Regiments of Life Guards, and
the Royal Regiment of Horse Guards, to whom
cuirasses have recently been restored. The other
Cavalry Regiments consist of Dragoon Guards,
Heavy and Light Dragoons, Hussars, and Lancers;
and although the long musket and bayonet have
been laid aside by the whole of the Cavalry, and
the Regiments are armed and equipped on the
principle of the old Horse (excepting the cuirass),
they continue to be styled Dragoons.</p>

<p>The old Regiments of Horse formed a highly
respectable and efficient portion of the Army,
and it is found, on perusing the histories of the
various campaigns in which they have been engaged,
that they have, on all occasions, maintained
a high character for steadiness and discipline, as
well as for bravery in action. They were formerly
mounted on horses of superior weight and physical
power, and few troops could withstand a
well-directed charge of the celebrated British
Horse. The records of these corps embrace a
period of 150 years&mdash;a period eventful in history,
and abounding in instances of heroism displayed
by the British troops when danger has threatened
the nation,&mdash;a period in which these Regiments
have numbered in their ranks men of loyalty,
valour, and good conduct, worthy of imitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>Since the Regiments of Horse were formed
into Dragoon Guards, additional improvements
have been introduced into the constitution of the
several corps; and the superior description of
horses now bred in the United Kingdom enables
the commanding officers to remount their regiments
with such excellent horses, that, whilst
sufficient weight has been retained for a powerful
charge in line, a lightness has been acquired which
renders them available for every description of
service incident to modern warfare.</p>

<p>The orderly conduct of these Regiments in
quarters has gained the confidence and esteem of
the respectable inhabitants of the various parts of
the United Kingdom in which they have been
stationed; their promptitude and alacrity in attending
to the requisitions of the magistrates in
periods of excitement, and the temper, patience,
and forbearance which they have evinced when
subjected to great provocation, insult, and violence
from the misguided populace, prove the value of
these troops to the Crown, and to the Government
of the country, and justify the reliance which is
reposed on them.</p>

<p class="noindent">The anarchy, devastation, and bloodshed which
had prevailed in Britain during the rebellion and
tyrannical usurpation of Cromwell, having been
succeeded by the restoration of monarchy,&mdash;the
despotic sway of sectarians and republicans put
down by the establishment of a regular government
on constitutional principles,&mdash;and the army
of the commonwealth disbanded, King Charles II.
directed his attention to domestic concerns, and
engaged in a matrimonial alliance with Donna
Catherina, Infanta of Portugal; and this event
gave rise to the formation of a troop of <span class="smcap">Cuirassiers</span>,
which was the nucleus of the corps now
bearing the distinguished title of <span class="smcap">The Royal
Regiment of Dragoons</span>.</p>

<p>By the marriage treaty the ancient and once
magnificent city of <span class="smcap">Tangier</span>, in Africa, and the
island of Bombay in the East Indies, were ceded
by the king of Portugal to the British crown; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
with a sum equal to three hundred thousand
pounds, constituted the Infanta's dowry.</p>

<p>As the possession of the important fortress of
<span class="smcap">Tangier</span>, with its harbour and local advantages,
appeared to open a new field for commercial
pursuits, and was expected to be followed by the
acquisition of extensive possessions in that part of
the world, four regiments of foot and a troop of
horse were appointed to garrison that fortress, and
the <span class="smcap">Earl of Peterborough</span> was constituted
captain general, chief governor, and vice admiral
of that part of his Majesty's dominions.</p>

<p>Three of the regiments of foot, commanded by
Sir Robert Harley, and Colonels Fitzgerald and
O'Farell, were withdrawn from the garrison of
Dunkirk, and were composed of men who had
fought in the royal cause during the civil war, and
afterwards in the Netherlands. The other regiment
of foot, (now the second, or Queen's royal,)
and the troop of <span class="smcap">Horse</span> (now <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>)
were raised in England by the Earl of Peterborough
in the autumn of 1661, and were mustered,
the former on Putney Heath, and the latter in
St. George's Fields, Southwark, in October.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The troop of <span class="smcap">Horse</span> consisted of three officers,
one quarter-master, four corporals, one trumpeter,
and one hundred private men; the ranks were
completed with veterans of the civil war, who
were armed with cuirasses, iron head-pieces called
potts, long swords, and a pair of large pistols, to
which a short carbine was afterwards added: they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
were mounted on long-tailed horses of superior
weight and power, wore high boots reaching to
the middle of the thigh, and scarlet vests: the
officers wore hats decorated with a profusion of
feathers; and both officers and men ornamented
their horses' heads and tails with large bunches of
ribands. The officers of this troop were,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Earl of Peterborough</span>, Captain and
Colonel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert Leech</span>, Captain-Lieutenant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James Mordaunt</span>, Cornet.</p>

<p>The appearance and equipment of the officers
and men were commended in the ephemeral publications
of that period. They embarked in the
middle of December, and in a letter to the Earl of
Peterborough, dated the 21st of December, the
King observed: 'I desire you to lett those honest
men knowe who are along with you, y<sup>t</sup> they
shall allwayes be in my particular care and
protection as persons y<sup>t</sup> venture themselves in
my service. And so, wishing you a good voyage,
I remain, &amp;c., <span class="smcap">Charles R.</span>'<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1662<br />1663</div>

<p>The troops arrived at Tangier in January, 1662,
and a war commencing soon afterwards between
the British occupants of this part of Africa and
the Moors, frequent encounters occurred between
detachments of the garrison of Tangier and the
barbarians, in which the former had a decided
superiority, and the English horsemen became
celebrated for gallant achievements.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The veteran <span class="smcap">Earl of Teviot</span>, who was appointed
governor of Tangier in 1663, in succession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>to the Earl of Peterborough, occasionally
penetrated into the adjacent country at the head
of a detachment of horse, and many brilliant exploits
were performed by the gallant English
troopers, among the rocks, in the woods, and on
the plains of this part of Africa, where they frequently
surprised lurking parties of Moors, and
captured cattle and other booty. The Africans
were, however, expert horsemen, and fought with
lance, sword, and short fusils.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1664</div>

<p>In February, 1664, a Moorish army, commanded
by Gaylan, usurper of Fez, appeared
before Tangier to besiege the fortress. On the
1st of March the Earl of Teviot, observing a body
of Moors, with a splendid scarlet standard, stationed
on an eminence near the city, ordered the
troop of <span class="smcap">Horse</span> to sally and bring in the standard.
The command was instantly obeyed; the brave
troopers, led by Captain <span class="smcap">Witham</span>, issued from
the city, traversed the intervening space with
signal intrepidity, routed the Moorish band,
and captured the standard, with which they returned
in triumph to the fortress, and erected it
on the top of one of the towers, to the surprise
and chagrin of the Moorish chiefs, who, being
posted at a distance with the main body of their
army, witnessed this brilliant exploit.</p>

<p class="right">[To face page 4</p>
</div></div>

<p>On the 13th of March the English horsemen
had a sharp encounter with some of the enemy's
best cavalry; and on the 27th, the Earl of Teviot
led them against a horde of Moorish lancers and
foot who were concealed in ambush, and the barbarians
were routed and pursued among the woods
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>and broken grounds with great slaughter. The
English horsemen, however, suffered severely on
the 4th of May in the same year, when the
governor, having been deceived by a false report,
advanced too far into the country, and was surprised
by a numerous band of Moors in ambush.
A fearful slaughter followed, and the <span class="smcap">Earl of
Teviot</span> was numbered among the slain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1665<br />1666</div>

<p>Frequent encounters took place in the subsequent
years between detached parties of British
and Moors, and in this desultory warfare the
English horsemen preserved their high character.
Hostilities were occasionally terminated, and renewed
after short intervals of peace; and during
the period of seventeen years the garrison resisted,
with firmness and success, every attempt of the
Moors against the city.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1679<br />1680</div>

<p>In 1679 a numerous army of Moors appeared
before Tangier, and destroyed two forts situate at
a distance from the town. They afterwards withdrew,
but re-appeared in the spring of 1680, with
augmented numbers, and swarms of expert Moorish
lancers, on light and swift horses, hovered round
the fortress and confined the Christians within
narrow limits. King Charles II. sent a battalion
of foot guards and sixteen companies of Dumbarton's
(now first royal) regiment, to reinforce the
garrison, and issued commissions for raising a
regiment of foot (now the fourth, or the King's
own) and six troops of <span class="smcap">Horse</span> in England: at
the same time arrangements were made for procuring
the service of three troops of Spanish
cavalry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>The six troops of English horse were raised by
Major-General the <span class="smcap">Earl of Ossory</span>, Lieutenant-Colonel
<span class="smcap">Sir John Lanier</span>,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Captains <span class="smcap">Robert
Pulteney</span>, <span class="smcap">John Coy</span>,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> <span class="smcap">Charles Nedby</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Thomas Langston</span>:<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> the three last-named officers
having been captains in the Duke of Monmouth's
regiment of horse, which was disbanded
only a few months before, their troops were
speedily completed with disciplined men who had
served in that regiment; and the demand for
cavalry at Tangier being urgent, they were furnished
with horses and equipment from the life
guards,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and arrived at Tangier in the early part
of September: at the same time the three troops
of Spanish horse arrived from Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The cavalry at Tangier now consisted of seven
efficient troops of cuirassiers, who were engaged
in a sally on the 12th of September, when the
Moorish horsemen were driven from under the
walls, and several outworks were recovered from
the barbarians. Another sally was made on the
21st of the same month, and on the following day
the English cuirassiers had a sharp skirmish with
the Moorish lancers, and had eight men killed and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>twenty wounded. An attack was made on the
enemy's lines on the 24th of September, when the
governor, <span class="smcap">Sir Palmes Fairborne</span>, was mortally
wounded.</p>

<p>On the 27th of September, the garrison,
amounting to about 4000 men, issued from the
fortress and attacked the Moorish army of about
15,000 men in its intrenched camp with signal
gallantry. So eager were the troopers to engage
their adversaries that a dispute occurred between
the English and Spanish horse, each claiming the
honour of charging first: the subject was referred
to the lieutenant-governor, Colonel Sackville, who
gave the Spaniards the precedence on this occasion,
because they fought as auxiliaries. The
Moors, having a great superiority of numbers,
stood their ground resolutely for some time; and
the thunder of cannon, the roll of musketry,
the clash of arms, the loud shouts of the British,
the cries of the Africans, produced an awful
scene of carnage and confusion. The English horse
stood in column of troops until the first intrenchment
was carried, and a space levelled for the
cavalry to pass, when they filed through the aperture
and rushed at speed upon the dark masses of
barbarians, who were broken, trampled down, and
pursued with a dreadful slaughter; while the musketeers,
pikemen, and grenadiers followed, shouting
as the dismayed Africans fell in succession
beneath the sabres of the English and Spanish
troopers. Many of the Moors faced about and
confronted their pursuers; numerous single combats
took place, and the vicinity of the camp was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
covered with slain. Captain <span class="smcap">Nedby's</span> troop of
English horse particularly distinguished itself,
and captured a splendid Moorish colour of curious
workmanship. The Spaniards also captured a
colour, Dumbarton's Scots another, and a fourth
was taken by a battalion of marines and seamen
from the fleet.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The Moorish legions, having been driven from
before the town with severe loss, this victory was
followed by a treaty of peace, and the troops of
horse raised by the Earl of Ossory, Sir John Lanier,
and Robert Pulteney, not having left England,
were disbanded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1682<br />1683</div>

<p>The improved military system introduced among
the Moors by European renegades, having rendered
it necessary to employ a much stronger
garrison at Tangier than formerly, the subject was
brought before parliament; but the question of a
popish successor to the throne was agitating the
people, and no grant was voted. The king, being
unwilling to bear the expense of the fortifications
and troops without pecuniary aid from parliament,
resolved to destroy the works and mole, and to
withdraw the garrison.</p>

<p>At this period the attention of King Charles II.
was directed to the improvement of his army; and,
resolving to retain the Tangier <span class="smcap">Horse</span> in his service,
he commissioned Colonel <span class="smcap">John Churchill</span>
(afterwards the great <span class="smcap">Duke of Marlborough</span>) to
raise a troop of dragoons at St. Alban's and its
vicinity; and <span class="smcap">Viscount Cornbury</span> (son of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Earl of Clarendon) to raise another troop of dragoons
at Hertford; and His Majesty constituted
these two troops, with the four troops of Tangier
horse, a regiment, to which he gave the distinguished
title of <span class="smcap">The King's Own Royal Regiment
of Dragoons</span>: the words "<span class="smcap">King's Own</span>"
were, however, discontinued soon afterwards, and
the regiment was styled "<span class="smcap">The Royal Regiment
of Dragoons</span>."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The colonelcy was conferred on
<span class="smcap">John Churchill</span>, who was advanced to the peerage
of Scotland by the title of Baron Churchill of
Aymouth; and the lieutenant-colonelcy on <span class="smcap">Viscount
Cornbury</span>, by commission dated the 19th
of November, 1683.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1684</div>

<p>The establishment was fixed by a warrant bearing

at once, into royal favour; and as soon as
it was regularly organized, it marched into quarters
in the borough of Southwark. On the 1st of
October it was reviewed, with several other corps,
by King Charles II., accompanied by the Queen,
the Duke of York, and many distinguished personages,
on Putney Heath; and on the 13th of that
month marched into quarters at Newbury, Abingdon,
and Hungerford. Shortly afterwards the

<div class="sidenote">1685</div>

<p>The decease of King Charles II. took place on
the 6th of February, 1685; and on the evening of
the same day, his successor (James II.) commanded
the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> to march into
quarters in the immediate vicinity of the metropolis.
Previous to the coronation they were furnished
with new standards, and the drummers and
hautboys with new liveries.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The ceremonial of
their Majesties' coronation was conducted with
extraordinary magnificence: but the agitated state
of the United Kingdom gave early indication of
approaching contests; and, towards the end of
April, two troops of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were
despatched to Carlisle, and placed under the command
of the governor, Sir Christopher Musgrave,
for the purpose of assisting in the seizure of 'divers
outlawed and seditious persons, who, for the
avoiding of Justice, have fled from Scotland into
the county of Cumberland and parts adjacent.'<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
These troops arrived at Carlisle on the 10th of
May, and several persons were apprehended. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>the middle of that month an insurrection, headed
by the <span class="smcap">Earl of Argyle</span>, broke out in Scotland;
and in June, <span class="smcap">James Duke of Monmouth</span> raised
the standard of rebellion in the west of England
and proclaimed himself king. The establishment
of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> was immediately augmented
to sixty men per troop: an independent
troop of dragoons, raised by Colonel <span class="smcap">Strother</span> in
1683, was incorporated in the regiment; and five
troops of dragoons were raised in the vicinity of
London by <span class="smcap">Richard Leveson</span>, <span class="smcap">John Williams</span>,
<span class="smcap">Edward Lea</span>, <span class="smcap">Francis Russel</span>, and <span class="smcap">Thomas
Hussey</span>, and added to the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>:
the numbers were thus increased to twelve troops,
amounting to about nine hundred officers and men.</p>

<p>Two troops of the regiment, with some other
forces, were despatched under Brigadier-General
Lord Churchill against the rebels in the west;
and on the 19th of June two other troops marched
for the same destination under the orders of
Lieutenant-General the Earl of Feversham, who
was appointed to the chief command of the King's
army. The royal forces having been united, the
four troops of dragoons were placed under the orders
of Viscount Cornbury; and the whole marched
in pursuit of the rebels.</p>

<p>After several marches and skirmishes the Duke
of Monmouth took post at Bridgewater; and the
Earl of Feversham, having sent a troop of the
<span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>, commanded by Captain Coy,
to Lamport, to secure that pass, and to gain intelligence
in the event of the rebels marching westward,
advanced with the royal army to Weston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
(about three miles from Bridgewater), where he
arrived on Sunday, the 5th of July. Having
quartered the cavalry in the village, and ordered
the infantry to encamp on a plain fronting <em>Sedgemoor</em>,
he sent a party of life guards to patrole in
the direction of Bristol, and posted a piquet of fifty
of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> with a squadron of the
blues supported by one hundred men of the royal
regiment of foot, on the moor, in front of the
camp. A guard of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> was
also posted over the artillery, which consisted of
sixteen pieces, and was drawn up on the high road
from Weston to Bridgewater.</p>

<p>During the night the Duke of Monmouth
marched out of Bridgewater with the view of surprising
the royal army; but the piquet in advance
gave the alarm, and after exchanging a few shots
with the rebels, retreated to the camp, and formed
on the right of the infantry; at the same time
the remainder of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>, being
aroused in their quarters in the village of Weston,
turned out in the dark in good order, and
formed on the left of the foot. The rebels commenced
the attack with loud shouts,&mdash;the contest
became general along the whole line,&mdash;and
the moor sparkled with fire. The rebel horse
soon gave way and fled in disorder; but their infantry
stood firm and fought with great resolution.
Day at length began to break; and the King's
foot advancing to the charge, whilst the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> and other cavalry attacked the flanks
of the rebels and put them in disorder, their whole
line then gave way and fled in confusion, and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
pursued across the moor and adjoining corn-fields
with great slaughter. Two troops of the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> continued the pursuit as far as Bridgewater,
where they were ordered to halt by the
Earl of Feversham.</p>

<p>In the mean time Captain Russel's troop of the
<span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> had been attached to three
Scots regiments of foot, which had recently arrived
from Holland under the command of Major-General
Mackay, and ordered to join the army in the
west; but, on the news of Monmouth's defeat
at Sedgemoor, these forces were directed to halt
at Bagshot; the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were subsequently
dispersed in small parties into the adjoining
counties to seize suspected persons; the Scots
regiments returned to Hounslow, and, after encamping
a short time on the heath, re-embarked
for Holland.</p>

<p>One troop of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> was ordered
to Winchester to escort the Duke of Monmouth
and other prisoners to London; on its arrival this
troop was quartered in the Borough of Southwark,
and it was under arms when the Duke was beheaded
on Tower Hill on the 15th of July. Two
other troops were ordered to Salisbury to mount
guard over the prisoners there, and were subsequently
directed to attend Judge Jeffries during
the trial and execution of the captured rebels; in
which painful service the troopers were spectators
of numerous acts of barbarity perpetrated by the
remorseless Judge, who sacrificed the lives of
upwards of two hundred persons in these "bloody
assizes," as historians have denominated them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>After the suppression of this rebellion the establishment
of the <span class="smcap">Royal Regiment of Dragoons</span>
was reduced to eight troops, of forty private men
per troop; and the supernumerary troops were
embodied into a regiment of dragoons, which was
commanded by the Duke of Somerset, and is
now the third light dragoons.</p>

<p>On the 1st of August Lord Churchill was appointed
colonel of the third troop of life guards,
and the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
was conferred on Lieutenant-Colonel Viscount
Cornbury. The two troops of the regiment having
returned from Carlisle, the whole were stationed
in London in October, and subsequently marched
into quarters in Devonshire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1686<br />1687<br />1688</div>

<p>King James II., being a Roman Catholic,
adopted measures calculated to effect the subversion
of the Protestant church; and, with the view
of overawing his subjects, he doubled the numbers
of the regular army, and had large bodies of troops
encamped, from time to time, on Hounslow Heath,
where he frequently attended in person and witnessed
the exercise of the troops. The <span class="smcap">Royal
Regiment of Dragoons</span> formed part of the force
at these encampments in the summer of 1686,
again in 1687, and in 1688. At this period many
noblemen and gentlemen, resolving to preserve the
nation from papal domination, solicited the Prince
of Orange to come to England with a Dutch force
to assist them in opposing the proceedings of the
King, and the Prince provided an armament for
that purpose.</p>

<p>The colonel of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
to have been a zealous Protestant, and to have
entered warmly into the measures taken to resist
the proceedings of the Papists who surrounded
the court. In November, 1688, when the Prince
of Orange had landed, <span class="smcap">Viscount Cornbury</span>,
having marched with his regiment to Salisbury,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
where the King's army was ordered to assemble,
and where the blues and eighth horse had already
arrived, resolved, in connexion with Lieut.-Colonel
Langston, of the eighth horse, and several
officers of the blues, to endeavour to take these
three regiments over to the Prince, in the following
manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>On the night of the 11th of November, directions
were given for the adjutants and quarter-masters
to await the arrival of the post, as orders
to march were expected. At twelve o'clock the
post arrived, when Colonel Langston opened the
bag before the officers, and the orders, apparently
from the Secretary-at-War, were produced, and
carried to Viscount Cornbury, who gave directions
for the regiments to proceed, at five o'clock, towards
the enemy. The regiments were accordingly
on the march before daylight on the
12th; continuing their progress throughout that
day and the following night (excepting a few
short halts to refresh the men and horses<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>),
on the afternoon of the 13th, they arrived at
Axminster, within six miles of the Prince of
Orange's quarters, where they were joined by the
Earl of Abingdon, Sir Walter Clerges, and about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>thirty other gentlemen, who pretended to be volunteers.
It was now asserted that a design of the
Dutch to surprise the quarters of the King's
forces had been discovered, and orders were
issued for beating up the quarters of the enemy
that night. Accordingly, after dark, the three
regiments were again in motion, and the Prince
of Orange, apprized of their approach by Lord
Cornbury, sent a large body of cavalry to meet
them. The greater part of the men, however,
resolved not to join the Prince of Orange, and,
when they observed what was taking place, they
galloped back. Major <span class="smcap">Robert Clifford</span>, of
the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>, marched back that regiment,
with the exception of a few officers and
about fifty dragoons, who accompanied Viscount
Cornbury. The blues also returned, excepting
about twenty-seven. But the Duke of St. Alban's
regiment (eighth horse) having mustered at
a distance, the men, ignorant of the transaction,
followed Colonel Langston to Honiton, where
they were received as friends by the Dutch general.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
Many of the men, however, returned
to the King's service; and the Duke of Berwick,
having collected the remains of the three regiments,
marched them back to Salisbury.</p>

<p>The king arrived at Salisbury on the 20th of
November, and his Majesty rewarded the loyalty
of Major Clifford by promoting him to the
colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>. The King,
however, soon discovered that the defection among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the officers was general, and that the soldiers, although
they were reluctant to desert his service,
were not disposed to fight in the cause of Papacy.
The superior officers of the army, with the nobility
and gentry, continued to flock to the Prince's
standard, and King James, alarmed for his personal
safety, returned in haste to London; at the
same time the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> marched into
garrison at Portsmouth. The Prince of Orange
advanced to the capital without experiencing serious
opposition; King James fled to France;
and the Prince, having assumed the reins of government,
restored Viscount Cornbury to the
colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>, and ordered
them to occupy quarters at Farnham and Alton.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1689</div>

<p>After the flight of the King to France, the
crown was conferred on William and Mary,
Prince and Princess of Orange. Their Majesties'
accession, however, met with opposition; and <span class="smcap">Viscount
Dundee</span> having induced several of the
Highland clans to take arms in favour of King
James, the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were immediately
ordered to the north.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> At the same time, the
Earl of Clarendon refusing to act with the new
government, his son, Viscount Cornbury, was
superseded in the command of the regiment by
the lieutenant-colonel, <span class="smcap">Anthony Hayford</span>, whose
commission as colonel was dated the 1st of July,
1689.</p>

<p>On the 27th of July, six battalions of infantry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>and two newly-raised troops of Scots horse, commanded
by Lieut.-General Mackay, were defeated
at <em>Killicrankie</em> by the Highlanders and a few
Irish, under Viscount Dundee and Brigadier-General
Cannon. Immediately after the action, the
<span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were directed to march to the
assistance of Lieut.-General Mackay, and they arrived
at Perth in the early part of August. The
object of the Commander-in-Chief being the prevention
of the descent of the mountaineers into the
lowlands, the regiment was posted a short time at
Forfar, under the command of Major-General Sir
John Lanier, and subsequently proceeded by forced
marches to Aberdeen. The Highlanders eventually
retired over the mountains by paths inaccessible
to cavalry, and separated to their homes.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the lord-lieutenant of Ireland
(Earl Tyrconnel) had retained the greater part of
that kingdom in the interest of King James. King
William sent an army to that country under the
veteran Duke Schomberg; and, immediately after
the dispersion of the rebel Highlanders, the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> were ordered to proceed to Ireland.
They embarked for this service in the early part
of October, landed at Carlingford on the 9th of
that month,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and were ordered to take post at
Armagh and Clownish, from whence they were
removed to the isle of Maghee.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1690</div>

<p>Several skirmishes occurred during the winter;
and in the spring of 1690 the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
were before <em>Charlemont</em>, which place was blockaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
by the King's forces. <em>Charlemont</em> was defended
by a garrison of 500 men, commanded by
Sir Teague O'Regan, a humorist, who returned
the following laconic answer to the summons to
surrender:&mdash;"Tell the General, from Teague
O'Regan, that he's an old knave; and, by St.
Patrick, he shall not have the town at all." He,
however, surrendered on the 14th of May, and
a detachment of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> escorted
the garrison towards Armagh.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Soon after the
surrender of Charlemont Lieut.-Colonel Edward
Matthews, from Leveson's (now third) dragoons,
was appointed colonel of the regiment. In June
it was encamped near Loughbritland, where it
was joined by a remount from England. On the
22nd of June King William arrived at the camp,
and "His Majesty was no sooner come than he
was in amongst the throng of the troops, and
observed every regiment very critically. This
pleased the soldiers mightily, and every one was
ready to give what demonstrations it was possible
both of his courage and duty."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>The French and Irish, commanded by King
James, took post on the banks of the <em>Boyne</em>, to
dispute the passage of that river. King William
marched to the opposite bank on the 30th of June,
and, on the morning of the 1st of July, the army
forded the river and drove the enemy from his
position with great slaughter. The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
and other British troops engaged in forcing
the passage of the <em>Boyne</em> are reported to have
"acquitted themselves well." King James fled
from the field and proceeded to France; and the
British army advanced on Dublin. A few days
after the battle King William reviewed the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> at Finglass, on which occasion they
brought 406 private troopers into the field.</p>

<p>On the 21st of July Major-General Kirke proceeded
with the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> and Queen
Dowager's and Colonel Cambron's regiments of
foot to Waterford, and summoned the place, and
on the 25th the governor capitulated.</p>

<p>At the moment when success attended the operations
of the army in Ireland, the English and
Dutch fleets, commanded by Lord Torrington and
Admiral Evertsen, were defeated by the French
fleet under the Count de Tourville, and the enemy
afterwards menaced the descent of a formidable
force on the British coast. King William commanded
a troop of life guards, with Count
Schomberg's horse (now seventh dragoon
guards), the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>, and Trelawny's
and Hastings' (fourth and thirteenth) foot to be
immediately embarked for England.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> landed at Highlake, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Cheshire, in the early part of August. The alarm
of invasion, however, soon subsided; and they
were ordered to return to Ireland, in which country
they again landed on the 20th of October, and
proceeded into extended cantonments in the county
of Cork. Many thousands of the Roman Catholic
peasantry of Ireland were, at this period, in arms
in behalf of King James: they were called <em>rapparees</em>,
and being formed into bands they made
frequent incursions into the cantonments of the
English regiments. Several men of the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> were murdered in their quarters by
these <em>rapparees</em>; and detachments of the regiment
were frequently sent out to scour the country and
chase these bands of marauders from the English
cantonments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1691</div>

<p>Towards the end of December a detachment of
the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> proceeded, with some other
troops, on an expedition commanded by Major-General
Tattea, and on the 1st of January, 1691,
attacked an Irish fort near <em>Scronclaird</em>, which was
taken in two hours, although the enemy had employed
five hundred men during two months to
build it.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>In the spring, when the army took the field,
the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were ordered to remain in
the county of Cork to restrain the incursions of
the <em>rapparees</em>, and to prevent the several forts
and small garrisons from being attacked. In the
early part of June Major Culliford, with a detachment
of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> and some militia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
penetrated that part of the country from whence
the enemy received their supplies, defeated the
Irish troops, and captured several droves of cattle.
At length General St. Ruth, who commanded the
French and Irish forces, detached two thousand
horse and foot to cover this part of the country.
Major Culliford, however, continued to make
inroads, and having advanced with one hundred
and twenty men of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>, and
fifty militia foot, he encountered two troops of
Irish cavalry. The English dragoons advanced
boldly to the charge, defeated their opponents,
killed twenty men upon the spot, and pursued the
remainder to Newmarket, where the Irish, being
reinforced, made another stand. The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>,
however, attacked them again with great
bravery, and having sabred fifteen, the remainder
fled in disorder, leaving a quantity of provision
and some cattle behind. Major Culliford despatched
eleven dragoons and twenty-four of the
militia to the rear with the booty, and then pursued
the fugitives four miles farther, when he
encountered five hundred of the enemy's horse
commanded by Sir James Cotter. Notwithstanding
their disparity of numbers, the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
boldly confronted their opponents, and made
a gallant resistance, but were eventually overpowered;
and forty men having fallen, Major Culliford
made good his retreat with the remainder.
In retiring, the dragoons,&mdash;chafed in spirit and
burning with revenge,&mdash;often turned round upon
their pursuers; and at length Captain Bower and
twenty men boldly faced about and killed about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
twenty of the Irish horsemen, whose eagerness in
the chase had caused them to advance in front of
their main body. In the meantime the eleven
dragoons and twenty-four of the militia, with the
captured cattle and stores, arrived at <em>Drumaugh</em>,
where they were attacked by a detachment of the
enemy, but defended themselves with success
until relieved by a body of troops under Colonels
Hastings and Ogleby.</p>

<p>At the time the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were making
these diversions, the main army, commanded by
Lieutenant-General De Ginkell, gained a decisive
victory over the French and Irish at Aghrim;
and on the 1st of August the regiment joined the
army at Banagher-bridge. The enemy collected
the remains of their defeated regiments at <em>Limerick</em>;
and towards the end of August Lieutenant-General
De Ginkell besieged that city, commencing
his work on the right bank of the Shannon:
the Irish army lay encamped at the same time on
the opposite side of the river.</p>

<p>A pontoon bridge having been prepared, several
regiments were ordered to cross the river at daybreak
of the 16th of September. The <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> took the lead; and Brigadier-General
Clifford,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> who commanded four regiments
of King James's dragoons, being taken by surprise,
made little opposition: some infantry, however,
attempted to make a stand; but a squadron
of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> dashed forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and routed them in an instant. Two or three
French and Irish battalions retired to a bog and
wood in their rear, from whence they were driven
with the loss of several men killed, and a French
lieut.-colonel, a captain, and a number of men
made prisoners. The regiments which had passed
the river advanced upon the enemy's camp, where
a curious spectacle presented itself:&mdash;many of the
Irish were running about in their shirts, some
were pulling down tents, others driving away cattle,
many were making their escape into the town,
and others hurrying towards the mountains; a
regiment of dragoons, whose horses were two
miles distance at grass, dispersed in confusion:
at the same time a party of horse buckled on their
arms and made a show of fighting; but they fled
on the advance of the English, who took possession
of the camp, where they found a quantity of
beef, brandy, and corn, with the saddles and
appointments of three hundred dragoons. The
<span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were commended by Lieut.-General
De Ginkell for their gallant conduct,
and they returned to the other side of the river on
the same day.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>On the 22nd of September the regiment, with
several other corps, crossed the Shannon into the
county of Clare; when the advance-guard, which
consisted of eighteen men of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>,
was attacked by a squadron of the Irish cavalry:
this small party sustained the first onset with
admirable firmness, but were forced to retire; part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
of the regiment, however, soon advanced to their
assistance, when the enemy was defeated and
chased under the range of their batteries, and
three small pieces of brass ordnance were captured.
Orders were then given for the infantry
to attack the works which covered Thoumond
bridge. These works were carried after a sharp
struggle; when the troops which had defended
them endeavoured to enter the town; but the
drawbridge had been raised, and they were left to
the mercy of the English, who slaughtered such
numbers, that the dead bodies lay in heaps on the
bridge higher than the parapet walls. Five colours
were taken on this occasion, and so many men
slain, drowned, and taken prisoners, that the enemy
surrendered the place in a few days afterwards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1692<br />1693</div>

<p>The conquest of Ireland having been effected,
the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> returned to England, where
they arrived in January, 1692, and marched into
dispersed cantonments in Leicestershire; and
during a part of the summer a detachment was
stationed in garrison at Portsmouth. The regiment
was subsequently stationed, on revenue duty,
in the maritime towns on the southern coast of the
kingdom; and in the autumn of 1693 it had the
honour of furnishing a relay of escorts to attend
King William from Margate to London, when His
Majesty returned from Holland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1694</div>

<p>The war with France, which was commenced in
1689, had been continued with varied success; and
in the spring of 1694 the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were
ordered to proceed on foreign service. They left
England in May; joined the army encamped near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Tirlemont in South Brabant, on the 21st of June,
and were reviewed by King William on the following
day. On arriving at this camp they were
ordered to take post in front of the village of Camtich,
and this quarter being much exposed to
attacks from the enemy, they were reinforced by
two regiments of Dutch infantry. The army
marched from Tirlemont on the 13th of July, and
encamped at Mont St. André and Ramilies, where
the regiment was formed in brigade with the royal
Scots and Fairfax's (now second and third) dragoons,
under the command of Brigadier-General
Matthews, and this brigade was encamped on the
left of the line. The French army encamped near
Huy, with their left upon the Mehaine. On the
17th of July a foraging party of the allies crossed
the river, and, meeting with several French squadrons,
a skirmish ensued, when the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> lost eight horses and had three men
wounded. On the 28th of the same month another
foraging party encountered a detachment of
the enemy, when the regiment had two men and
several horses killed. The allied army was again in
motion on the 8th of August: much manœuvring,
and some skirmishing took place between the
hostile squadrons, but no general engagement
occurred. On the 29th of August the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> were stationed at Wacken&mdash;a post
situate at the junction of the Mandel and the
Scheldt; and in October they marched into cantonments
in the villages between Ghent and Sans-van-Ghent.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1695</div>

<p>In the spring of 1695 the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
marched to Dixmude, forming part of a division
of the army commanded by Major-General Ellenberg,
and were brigaded with Lloyd's (now third)
dragoons and a regiment of Danish cavalry. On
the 7th of June the Duke of Wirtemberg took
command of this division, and attacked the French
forts at <em>Kenoque</em> as a diversion to conceal King
William's design upon the strong and almost
impregnable fortress of <em>Namur</em>, which he commanded
to be invested shortly afterwards. The
<span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> joined the covering army towards
the end of June; but were detached to
Bruges in July: they were subsequently recalled
from thence and joined the camp between Genappe
and Waterloo, from whence they proceeded to the
vicinity of <em>Namur</em>, to protect the troops employed
in the siege from a threatened attack of the French
army. After the surrender of the important fortress
of <em>Namur</em>, the regiment marched into cantonments
behind Ghent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1696</div>

<p>The French menaced an attack upon the quarters
of the allied army in Flanders in the spring of
1696, when the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were suddenly
called from their cantonments to encamp on the
banks of the canal between Ghent and Bruges,
where they were reviewed by King William on
the 29th of May. They served the campaign of
this year with the army of Flanders, commanded by
the Prince of Vandemont, and were brigaded with
the royal Scots and royal Irish (second and fifth)
dragoons, commanded by Brigadier-General Matthews.
The object of this army was the protection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of Ghent, Bruges, and the maritime towns of
Flanders: no general action occurred; but a party
of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>, with a detachment of
Langston's horse (now fourth dragoon guards),
surprised one of the French out-guards on the
night of the 20th of September and took thirty
prisoners. This appears to be the only action in
which the regiment took part during the campaign
of this year; and on the 6th of October it marched
into quarters in the villages behind the Bruges
canal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1697</div>

<p>During the campaign of 1697 the regiment
served under King William in the army of Brabant,
and was brigaded with the royal Scots and
Eppinger's dragoons.</p>

<p>On the 28th of May Brigadier-General Matthews
died; and on the 30th His Majesty conferred
the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> on <span class="smcap">Thomas
Lord Raby</span>, afterwards Earl of Strafford.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1698</div>

<p>The enemy, having great superiority of numbers,
besieged and took <em>Aeth</em>, and afterwards menaced
Brussels; but were frustrated in their designs by
King William. The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were encamped
before Brussels in June; and subsequently
at Wavre. Hostilities were terminated in September
by the treaty of Ryswick, and after the
conclusion of peace, the regiment embarked from
the Netherlands,&mdash;landed at the Red House in
Southwark on the 21st of November, and, at the
end of the same month, marched into extensive
quarters in Yorkshire, where the establishment,
which during the war had been eight troops,
amounting to five hundred and ninety officers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
men, was reduced to six troops of two hundred and
ninety-four officers and men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1699<br />1700</div>

<p>During the two succeeding years the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> occupied quarters in Lancashire and
Leicestershire. In June, 1700, they assembled on
Hounslow Heath and were reviewed by King William
III., who was pleased to express his royal
approbation of their appearance and discipline.
Leaving the south of England in July, they proceeded
into quarters in Yorkshire and Cumberland,
with one troop stationed in garrison at Carlisle and
another at Hull.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1701<br />1702</div>

<p>In 1701 the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were stationed
in Yorkshire, with three troops in garrison at
Hull; at this period the ambitious Louis XIV.
of France violated the treaties he had entered
into, and procured the accession of his grandson,
Philip, Duke of Anjou, to the throne of Spain.
War was resolved upon, and the establishment
of the regiment was augmented to eight troops
amounting to five hundred and thirty-two officers
and men; and it embarked for Holland in the
beginning of March, 1702. Before the transports
sailed, the death of King William occurred
(8th March, 1702), when the regiment was disembarked
and placed in cantonments in the villages
in the immediate vicinity of the metropolis. In a
few days afterwards, Her Majesty Queen Anne
having resolved to pursue the foreign policy of her
predecessor, the regiment re-embarked, and after
landing at Williamstadt, went into quarters at Breda,
where it was formed in brigade with the royal
Scots and royal Irish (second and fifth) dragoons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
under the command of that excellent officer, Brigadier-General
Ross, and was placed as a guard to
the English train of artillery.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1703</div>

<p>A powerful French army was in the field menacing
the frontiers of Holland. The <span class="smcap">Earl of
Marlborough</span> assembled the forces under his
orders towards the end of June, and in July the
<span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> joined the army with the train
of artillery. By a daring advance the British commander
disconcerted the designs of his opponents,
who retired without venturing an engagement.
The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were employed in covering
the sieges of <em>Venloo</em>, <em>Ruremonde</em>, and <em>Stevenswaert</em>;
and took part in the capture of the city of
<em>Liege</em>: they afterwards marched back to Holland,
and were quartered at Arnheim, the capital of the
province of Guelderland, where they were reviewed
in April, 1703, by their colonel, <span class="smcap">Lord Raby</span>, who
was passing through Holland on his way to Prussia,
as envoy extraordinary to that court.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>At the commencement of the campaign of 1703
the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were employed in covering
the siege of <em>Bonn</em>, and afterwards joined the army
near Maestricht, with six battalions of infantry
commanded by the Prince of Hesse, and were
formed in brigade with the same regiments as in
the preceding year.</p>

<p>On the advance of the allied army commanded
by the <span class="smcap">Duke of Marlborough</span>, the French retreated,
and took post behind their fortified lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 27th of July the British commander proceeded,
with four thousand horse and dragoons,
towards the enemy's intrenchments, and Lieutenant
<span class="smcap">Benson</span>, with thirty men of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>,
who formed the advance-guard, charged
and defeated a piquet of forty French horsemen,
and chased them to the barriers of their intrenchments
with signal gallantry, which gave his
Grace an opportunity of advancing within musket-shot
of the lines. He was desirous of attacking
these formidable works, but was prevented by the
timidity and pertinacity of the Dutch generals and
field deputies. In August, when the siege of <em>Huy</em>
was undertaken, the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were encamped
on the banks of the river Maese, to secure
the bridge, and to keep up the communication.
They were subsequently engaged in the siege of
<em>Limburg</em>, a city situated on a pleasant eminence
among the woods near the banks of the little river
Wesdet. Spanish Guelderland having been delivered
from the power of France, and the Dutch
freed from the dread of an invasion, the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> quitted the vicinity of Limburg and
marched back to Holland. In the mean time
circumstances had occurred which occasioned
their removal from the army commanded by the
celebrated <span class="smcap">Duke of Marlborough</span>, to another
theatre of war.</p>

<p>During the summer the Emperor of Germany
and Prince Joseph renounced their pretensions to
the Spanish monarchy in behalf of Archduke
Charles, who was acknowledged as King of Spain
by several of the states of Europe; and a treaty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
alliance having been concluded with the King of
Portugal, the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were selected to
accompany the Archduke to Lisbon, and to take
part in the attempt to place him on the throne of
Spain by force of arms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1704</div>

<p>The Portuguese monarch having engaged to
provide horses for the English cavalry, the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> transferred their horses to the British
regiments in Holland, and embarked, dismounted,
in October; but were so long detained by contrary
winds and severe weather, that they did not arrive
at the capital of Portugal before March, 1704,
when they landed with the remainder of the
British and Dutch forces commanded by <span class="smcap">Duke
Schomberg</span>.</p>

<p>In consequence of the horses produced by the
Portuguese authorities being of so inferior a description
that the English officers rejected the
greater part of them, only twenty men per troop
of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were mounted; the dismounted
men proceeded to Abrantes to await the
arrival of horses, and the mounted men advanced
to the frontiers of Portugal, and encamped on a
pleasant plain near Estremos. Tardiness and
inability were, however, manifested by the Portuguese
authorities to such an extent, that the <span class="smcap">Duke
of Berwick</span>, having arrived from France with
eighteen battalions of infantry and nineteen squadrons
of cavalry, and taken the command of the
French and Spanish forces, attacked the frontiers
of Portugal before the allies were prepared to take
the field. The court of Lisbon was alarmed, the
provinces were in consternation; the <span class="smcap">Duke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Schomberg</span> solicited to be recalled, and the
<span class="smcap">Earl of Galway</span> was sent with reinforcements
to Portugal, and appointed to the command of
the British forces in that country.</p>

<p>One hundred and twenty men of the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> formed part of a body of cavalry, which
crossed the frontiers and made a successful incursion
into the Spanish territory. Extraordinary
measures were adopted to procure horses, and at
the close of the summer the regiment had upwards
of three hundred mounted men in the field. In
the autumn the army was enabled to act on the
offensive, and the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were among
the forces which penetrated Spain; but on arriving
at the vicinity of Ciudad Rodrigo, the enemy was
found so advantageously posted on the opposite
side of the Agueda, that the Portuguese generals
would not venture the passage of the river; and,
after reconnoitring the hostile army several times,
the allies returned to Portugal, and the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> went into village cantonments in the
Alentejo.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1705</div>

<p>During the winter and the spring of 1705 the
regiment procured an additional supply of horses,
and when it again took the field it was much
better mounted than in the preceding year. It
joined the army in April, and, advancing into
Spanish Estremadura, formed part of the force
which invested <em>Valencia de Alcantara</em>, which
fortress was captured in the early part of May.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>
<p><em>Albuquerque</em> was subsequently besieged and taken;
and the capture of Badajoz was contemplated, but
that undertaking was abandoned until the summer's
heat was abated.</p>

<p>In the mean time an expedition had been fitted
out in England, and a land force, commanded by
Lieut.-General the Earl of Peterborough, embarked
for the purpose of furthering the designs
of the house of Austria. The fleet arrived at
Lisbon in June, and, King Charles resolving to
accompany the expedition, the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> and Cunningham's
(now eighth) dragoons, and four regiments
of foot, were embarked to strengthen the
land force. The fleet put to sea, and, after
several consultations among the general and naval
officers, an attack on <em>Barcelona</em> was resolved upon.
The fleet arrived before that fortress on the 22nd
of August (N.S.), and on the 24th the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> landed near a river called Bassoz, on
the east side of the city, and encamped about a
mile from the walls, in a place well fortified by
nature, where the army was joined by many of the
country people, who were formed into bands, and
acted as a guerilla force: "they were" (as Bishop
Burnet observes) "good at plundering, but could
not submit to regular discipline, nor were they
willing to expose themselves to dangerous services."</p>

<p>The siege of <em>Barcelona</em> was considered a romantic
enterprise, and it excited a lively interest
in every nation in Christendom. The garrison
equalled in strength the besieging army within
about two thousand men, and, according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
ordinary rules and chances of war, success appeared
impossible. The siege was, however,
commenced, and on the 14th of September an
attack was made on the strong fortress of <em>Montjuich</em>,
situate on an eminence overlooking the
town, on which occasion a detachment of the
<span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> was posted between this detached
fortress and the city to prevent a sally of
the Spanish cavalry. The garrison of Fort
Montjuich held out three days, and then surrendered.
During the remainder of the siege the
<span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were almost constantly on
duty, the besieging army not having a sufficient
number of men to form two reliefs of the ordinary
guards in the trenches and on the batteries:
the siege was, however, persisted in, and the
governor capitulated on the 9th of October. The
garrison was preparing to march out on the 14th,
when numbers of the guerillas and armed peasantry,
having entered by the breach in hopes of
obtaining plunder, united with the inhabitants of
the town, and attacked the houses of the French
and other persons known to be in the interest of
the Duke of Anjou; they also threatened to massacre
the governor and garrison: but the Earl of
Peterborough marched into the town at the head of
a troop of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> and a detachment
of grenadiers, and restored order and tranquillity.
On this occasion his lordship narrowly escaped
falling a sacrifice to his humanity. A Spaniard
having fired at the Duke of Popoli, the ball passed
through the Earl of Peterborough's periwig. The
valour and perseverance of the British and Dutch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
having achieved the conquest of Barcelona, at
which (as Dr. Freind observes) "all Europe
wondered," nearly every town in Catalonia declared
for King Charles III., and the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> were placed in garrison at Tortosa,
excepting a detachment which remained at Barcelona.
Shortly afterwards Valencia declared in
favour of the house of Austria.</p>

<p>A French and Spanish force, commanded by
the Conde de las Torres, was detached to retake
the revolted towns, and in December the enemy
besieged <em>St. Mattheo</em>, which place was defended
by a party of Spaniards, commanded by a stout-hearted
Welshman, named <span class="smcap">Jones</span>, who made a
resolute defence. The Earl of Peterborough advanced
with two hundred of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
and a thousand British foot to relieve the place.
This force was not more than one-fifth of the
numbers of the besieging army: but, by night
marches among the woods and mountains, and by
circulating false reports, the British succeeded in
surprising their opponents; and the Spanish commander,
not knowing the numbers of his enemy,
and being deceived by spies, made a precipitate
retreat, and his rear-guard was pursued by the
<span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> over the mountains to Albocazar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1706</div>

<p>The French and Spanish army continued to
retire, and was pursued by the Earl of Peterborough
with a force so much inferior in numbers,
that the record of these events appears almost
incredible,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and exhibits the native valour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
spirit of enterprise, and temerity of the British
commander, with the pusillanimity and credulity
of the Spaniards, in a strong light. Four troops
of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> formed part of that small
body of men with which the Earl of Peterborough
pursued a numerous army. The services in which
they were engaged partook of the nature of a guerilla
warfare, and put to a severe test the discipline,
bravery, and intelligence of the men. Being
divided into small parties, and united with bands
of armed peasantry, they were continually performing
night marches among the woods and
mountains, and, hovering about the rear and flanks
of the Spanish army, keeping it in a state of
alarm, which services were performed in concert
with spies; and although, under these circumstances,
it must have been difficult to preserve
subordination and discipline, yet the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
performed these duties to the satisfaction
of the commander-in-chief. On one occasion
"the Spaniards employed by my lord Peterborough
informed the Conde de las Torres of a
considerable force that was upon his left, somewhat
before him, and certainly designed, as
they told him, to take some passes which might
prevent his entrance into the plains leading to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Valencia, and that there were English troops
among them. This the Spanish general thinking
impossible, one of the spies offered to give
any two or three officers he pleased to appoint
the satisfaction of seeing what he affirmed.
Upon this two officers, in the country habit,
went along with him to a place where, pretending
to alight and refresh themselves, they
were seized by ten English dragoons that were
posted there on purpose, and had marched in
the mountains all night with the spies. The
Spaniards being thus surprised and seized, the
spy pretended the guard was drunk, and the
officers, seeing a couple of dragoons lying apparently
in that condition, slipped into the stable
and took three of the horses, and so returned to
the Conde de las Torres. This was enough to
confirm the intelligence and gain credit to the
spy, as officers of that country never fail to
magnify their dangers and escapes. Sometimes
the dragoons were brought prisoners, by consent,
into the Spanish camp, by country people,
seeming in their interest. By such artful means,
and by such diligent application, a little body of
men, about twelve or thirteen hundred cavalry
and two thousand infantry, were brought to join
in the neighbourhood of Castillon de la Plana."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
Such were the services in which the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
were engaged, and an immense tract of
country was delivered from the power of the
enemy. A most romantic part of the adventure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
was, that the Earl of Peterborough, being deficient
in cavalry, procured eight hundred Spanish
horses, and constituted Lord Barrymore's regiment
(now thirteenth foot) a corps of dragoons,
of which he appointed the lieut.-colonel, Edward
Pearce, colonel.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> accompanied the Earl
of Peterborough to <em>Valencia</em>. The enemy brought
forward a numerous army to besiege this important
place; but the British commander issued from the
city with his gallant horsemen, and surprised and
captured the Spanish battering-train; he also penetrated,
by a night march, to the rear of their
army, and attacked and defeated their reinforcements;
and by these and other achievements of a
similar character, which exhibit the valour and
excellent conduct of the troops under his orders,
he frustrated the designs of the enemy.</p>

<p>These brilliant successes alarmed the courts of
France and Spain, and a powerful attempt to regain
the possession of the towns which had acknowledged
King Charles was determined upon.
The Spaniards were desirous of commencing with
Valencia, but they were overruled by orders from
France; and, the English fleet having left <em>Barcelona</em>
in the autumn, the siege of that place was
undertaken by a land force commanded by King
Philip in person, and the French fleet under the
Count de Toulouse.</p>

<p>The Earl of Peterborough hastened from Valencia
with the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> and a select
number of men from the other corps, and on his
arrival at the vicinity of Barcelona he found the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
town invested by a numerous army and a fleet.
He immediately took to the mountains with his
hardy dragoons and about two thousand foot, and,
being joined by numbers of the armed peasantry,
he was constantly hovering near the besieging
army with his detachments, interrupting the
enemy's communications, cutting off their supplies,
and attacking their out-guards; and on one
occasion he succeeded in throwing a number of
men into the town. At length the British fleet
arrived with reinforcements; the French admiral
withdrew with precipitation, and, Barcelona being
thus relieved, the enemy raised the siege on the
12th of May, 1706, and retreated towards Roussillon,
leaving behind his artillery, ammunition,
stores, and sick and wounded men. A squadron
of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> and some other cavalry
were ordered to pursue the retiring army, and,
being joined by hundreds of armed peasantry,
they attacked the enemy's rear-guard several
times, and took a number of prisoners. The
Spaniards killed every man who fell into their
hands; but the prisoners taken by the English
and Dutch met with good treatment.</p>

<p>After the flight of the enemy from before Barcelona,
the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> returned to Valencia,
from whence they expected to advance with
King Charles immediately upon Madrid, to join
the allied army commanded by the Marquis das
Minas and the Earl of Galway, which being superior
in numbers to the French and Spanish forces
on the frontiers of Portugal, arrived at the capital
of Spain towards the end of June. King Charles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
however, delayed to proceed to Madrid, and being
guided by pernicious councils, he eventually went
round by way of Arragon. Meanwhile the French
and Spanish forces which, after raising the siege
of Barcelona, had retired to France, re-entered
Spain, and uniting with the forces under the Duke
of Berwick, compelled the army of Portugal to
retire from Madrid. The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
marched from Valencia in July, together with
Pearce's dragoons, a regiment of Castilian foot,
and a regiment of Germans, and on the 8th of
August joined the army of Portugal at Guadalaxara,
from whence they marched to Chinchon,
a town of Toledo, eighteen miles from Madrid,
where they remained about a month.</p>

<p>The allied army, being unable to make head
against the superior numbers of the enemy, retired,
and having crossed the Tagus at Fuente Duennas,
continued their march through the fine champaign
country of La Mancha, and took up their winter
quarters in Valencia, extending their cantonments
from Requena to Denia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1707</div>

<p>In the spring of 1707 the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
were ordered to take the field, and after a long
and difficult march they joined the army in the
beginning of April; but no expectation of a general
engagement being entertained, and land carriage
being difficult to procure, they were detached on
the 9th of April as far as Denia, for their clothing,
and to refresh their horses a short time in village
cantonments. While they lay at Collera, a town
situate at the mouth of the river Xucar, in the
province of Valencia, the battle of Almanza was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
fought on the 25th of April, when the allied army,
commanded by the Marquis das Minas and the
Earl of Galway, was nearly annihilated by the
French and Spaniards under the Duke of Berwick.</p>

<p>Soon after this disaster the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
joined the wreck of the allied army, which had
been collected by the Earl of Galway, and were
employed for three months in marches and countermarches,
observing the motions of the opposing
army and endeavouring to preserve the rich and
extensive province of Catalonia from the power of
the enemy. They afterwards formed part of the
force assembled for the relief of Lerida, but the
undertaking was found to be impracticable. The
enemy gained possession of Arragon and Valencia,
but were prevented acquiring all the advantages
from the victory at Almanza which had been anticipated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1708</div>

<p>During the winter and succeeding spring exertions
were made to bring the regiments in Catalonia
into as efficient a state as possible; and when
the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> took the field to serve the
campaign of 1708, they were reported to be "in
excellent condition."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The allied army in Catalonia
was under the orders of Marshal Count Guido
de Staremberg, an officer of reputation, who had
commanded the Imperial troops in Hungary. The
services of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were of a defensive
character; sending out detachments to reconnoitre,
furnishing piquets and patroles, and traversing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the mountain districts of Catalonia in
small parties, were the only duties they were
called upon to perform. They were encamped a
short time in a valley near Monblanco, subsequently
on a fertile plain near Cervera, and they
passed another winter in cantonments in Catalonia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1709</div>

<p>The early part of the campaign of 1709 was
also passed in defensive movements: the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> were encamped with the army on the
banks of the Segré, and having forded that river
in August, the town of <em>Balaguer</em>, situate at the
foot of a hill on the banks of that stream and in
a district of uncommon fertility, was captured;
also <em>Ager</em>, a place twelve miles from Balaguer.
After placing garrisons in these towns the army
repassed the river, and the regiments went into
cantonments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1710</div>

<p>The campaign of 1710 was distinguished by
more important events, the two claimants to the
throne of Spain heading their armies in person.
The enemy was first in the field, and commenced
operations with the siege of Balaguer, but retired
on the approach of the allied army. The <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> were subsequently encamped on the
banks of the Segré; and when King Charles
joined the army, they were detached to meet his
Majesty and to escort him to the camp.</p>

<p>After some manœuvring, Lieutenant-General
<span class="smcap">Stanhope</span> (afterwards <span class="smcap">Earl Stanhope</span>), who
commanded the British troops in Spain, being at
the head of the leading column of the allied army
on the march towards Alfaras, discovered, on the
evening of the 27th of July, a body of the enemy's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
forces in front of the village of <em>Almanara</em>, and
obtained the King's permission to attack them
with the cavalry, of which the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
had the honour to form part.</p>

<p>The sun was declining from the horizon, and
the shades of evening were gathering over the
valleys of Catalonia, when the British commander
led forward his warlike horsemen. Before him
appeared twenty-two squadrons of Castilian
cavalry, the pride and flower of the Spanish army,
with King Philip's life guards on the right; a
second line of the same numbers was seen in the
rear, and nine battalions of infantry supported the
cavalry. Against this force the gallant <span class="smcap">Stanhope</span>
advanced at the head of Harvey's horse
(now second dragoon guards); his front line consisted
of sixteen squadrons, with a reserve of six
squadrons. The Spaniards came forward to meet
their opponents in all the pomp of war, and a noble
spectacle presented itself. The foaming squadrons
dashed upon each other, but the contest was of
short duration. The enemy's left soon gave way,&mdash;the
Spanish life guards were routed with the
loss of a standard and a pair of kettle drums,&mdash;their
second line fled in confusion,&mdash;the infantry
were seized with a panic; and <span class="smcap">Stanhope's</span>
troopers chased the fugitives from the field with
great slaughter, following them among the rocks
and dells until the darkness rendered it impossible
to distinguish friends from foes.</p>

<p>The result of this cavalry action disconcerted
the plans of the enemy; King Philip called in his
detachments and retired; and the allied army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
moved forward in pursuit. After following the
retiring army many days, sometimes crossing valleys,
and at other times traversing wild but beautiful
regions among rocks and mountains, and
obtaining possession of numerous towns in Arragon,
the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> overtook the enemy's
rear-guard in the pass of <em>Penalva</em>, on the 15th
of August, when a sharp skirmish ensued, and
Lieut.-Colonel <span class="smcap">Colberg</span>, who commanded the
regiment, was wounded and taken prisoner.</p>

<p>Continuing the pursuit during the four succeeding
days, the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> passed the Ebro
with the leading column under Major-General
Carpenter, and on the evening of the 19th of
August the French and Spanish forces were discovered
in order of battle on the right of <em>Saragossa</em>,
a city pleasantly situated on the river
Ebro, in a very plentiful country, abounding with
every necessary for the support and convenience of
life, and once the delight of Julius Cæsar, who
erected a splendid palace there. Preparations
were made to attack the enemy on the following
day; the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> formed part of the
cavalry of the left wing, commanded by Lieut.-General
<span class="smcap">Stanhope</span>, and were opposed to the
enemy's right on the brow of a steep hill.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 20th of August
a heavy cannonade commenced; and as the mountains
re-echoed the sound, and the smoke, tinged
with the rays of the sun, rose in curling clouds
and formed a glittering dome over the opposing
armies, King Charles and his suite galloped along
the line, and his Majesty's presence infused a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
glowing ardour into the troops. About mid-day
Lieut.-General Stanhope led the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
and other British horsemen on the left
against their adversaries, and a sharp cavalry
action ensued, in which the French troopers (being
superior in numbers) had the advantage; but
Stanhope's second line of cavalry repulsed the
enemy. The British dragoons rallied, and returning
to the charge, a sanguinary sword-fight took
place at the foot of the hill; but six squadrons of
Portuguese dragoons on the extreme left fled
before the troops advancing against them, without
waiting to be attacked. The battle extended
along the front to the banks of the Ebro, and the
Imperial, Dutch, and Palatine troops vied with
the British in feats of gallantry. The Royals,
Pepper's (now eighth) and Stanhope's dragoons,
continuing the fight, gained some advantage;
Harvey's horse signalized themselves; and four
English battalions, commanded by Major-General
<span class="smcap">Wade</span>, being mixed with the cavalry of the left
wing, behaved with remarkable intrepidity and
heroism. The British infantry, throwing off their
knapsacks, sprang up the acclivity and attacked
their opponents sword in hand: finally, the
enemy was driven from the field with prodigious
slaughter, and the loss of six thousand prisoners,
twenty-two pieces of cannon, seventy-two standards
and colours, the ammunition, baggage, and plate
of King Philip; and the city of <em>Saragossa</em> was captured,
with its military stores of ammunition, provision
and clothing. The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> passed
the night in the fields near the town, and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
thanked by King Charles for their distinguished
gallantry.</p>

<p>After this victory the army once more advanced
to Madrid, and King Charles made his public
entry into the capital on the 28th of September;
but the army of Portugal not advancing to sustain
this forward movement, the most disastrous results
followed. King Philip called to his aid
troops from Estremadura,&mdash;reinforcements arrived
from France,&mdash;the Castilian peasantry took arms
in his behalf,&mdash;and the allied army was once more
forced to retire.</p>

<p>On the 11th of November King Charles withdrew
from the army, taking with him the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> and Staremberg's Imperialists, and
proceeded to Cienpoznelos. The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
appear to have become a favourite corps
with his Majesty, and when he retired to Barcelona
he took with him two squadrons of the
regiment as a body-guard. The other squadron
remained with the army, and during the retreat it
formed part of the rear column on the left commanded
by Lieut.-General <span class="smcap">Stanhope</span>. This
retrograde movement was performed under great
difficulties from the hostile spirit of the Castilians,
inclement weather, and a scarcity of forage and
provision. On the 6th of December the column
of which the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> formed part
arrived at <em>Brihuega</em>, a village of about a thousand
houses, situate in the mountains of Castile,
near the river Tajuna, where they halted on the
following day. While the troops were reposing
in this rural seclusion, the town was suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
surrounded by the French and Spanish forces
commanded by the Duke of Vendosme. The
British, though invested by a force of more than
ten times their own numbers, resolved on a vigorous
defence; but unfortunately they had no artillery,
very little ammunition, and the wall round
the village was in a ruinous condition. The
enemy forced the gates, battered down part of the
wall with their cannon, and assaulted the place by
storm, but were repulsed with severe loss. A
second assault was given, and the British troops,
having spent all their ammunition, defended themselves
a short time with stones and other missiles;
but were eventually forced to surrender prisoners
of war.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1711</div>

<p>The officers and men of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
who were thus made prisoners were sent to France,
and, after being exchanged, were removed to
England, and subsequently to Scotland. The
remainder of the regiment continued in Spain,
where it served under Lieut.-General the Duke of
Argyle.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1712</div>

<p>In 1711 the Emperor Joseph died, King
Charles proceeded from Spain to Germany,
and was elected Emperor of the Romans. This
event removed one of the competitors for the
throne of Spain. King Philip made a formal
renunciation of his claim to succeed to the throne
of France, and the danger of an union of the
kingdoms of France and Spain was thus removed.
Negotiations for a general peace were commenced,
and in the summer of 1712 the officers and men
of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> quitted Spain and returned
to England. They were mounted on
Spanish horses; but before they quitted Catalonia
their horses were sold, and the men returned home
dismounted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1713</div>

<p>After their arrival in England the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> were stationed in dispersed quarters in
Yorkshire; and the establishment was fixed at
twenty-seven officers, eight quarter-masters, and
three hundred and twenty-eight non-commissioned
officers and private men. During the summer of
1713 a detachment of the regiment proceeded to
Dover, and received a draft of two hundred horses
from Kerr's (now seventh) dragoons, which regiment
was ordered to proceed, dismounted, to Ireland,
where it was disbanded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1714</div>

<p>On the decease of Queen Anne on the 1st of
August, 1714, the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> left Yorkshire,
and marched into quarters in the villages near
London; but after the arrival of King George I.
from Hanover they returned to Yorkshire, and a reduction
of fifty men was made in the establishment.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1715</div>

<p>In January, 1715, two troops of the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span>, with three troops of the Scots greys,
and a newly-raised troop of dragoons, were incorporated
into a regiment&mdash;the present seventh
hussars.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The establishment was thus reduced to
six troops; and on the 13th of June in the same
year the colonelcy was conferred on <span class="smcap">Richard
Lord Cobham</span>, who was advanced to the dignity
of Viscount three years afterwards.</p>

<p>At this period Jacobite principles were very
prevalent in the United Kingdom; and in September,
1715, the Earl of Mar raised the standard of
rebellion in Scotland, and excited the clans to take
arms in favour of the Pretender. The <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> were immediately ordered to the
North; and in the early part of October they
arrived at Edinburgh, from whence they marched
immediately afterwards, and, being placed under
the command of Lieutenant-General Carpenter,
went in pursuit of a body of rebels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1716</div>

<p>After several marches and countermarches Lieutenant-General
Carpenter arrived at Jedburgh on
the 30th of October: three days afterwards he
ascertained that a division of the rebel army had
marched in the direction of Carlisle, and he instantly
went in pursuit of them. The rebels, however,
eluded his vigilance, and arrived without
opposition at <em>Preston</em>, in Lancashire. Major-General
Wills, who commanded in Cheshire, assembled
several regiments, and marched towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Preston. In the mean time Lieutenant-General
Carpenter, with the <span class="smcap">Royal</span>, Molesworth's, and
Churchill's dragoons,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> were marching with all
possible expedition from Scotland; and they arrived
before Preston about mid-day on Sunday, the
13th of November, when they found the town surrounded
by the troops under Major-General Wills:
some sharp fighting had previously taken place,
but on the arrival of the forces from Scotland, the
rebels surrendered at discretion. On the same day
another division of the rebel army was defeated at
Sheriff-moor, near Dumblain; and in the early
part of 1716 the Pretender and insurgent chiefs
made their escape to France, and the common
people retired to their homes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1717</div>

<p>After the suppression of this rebellion, the
<span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were stationed in Leicestershire
and Nottinghamshire, from whence they marched,
in February, 1717, to Newcastle upon Tyne, and
were placed under the command of Major-General
Wills. This march was occasioned by the preparations
made by Charles XII., King of Sweden, for
an expedition to England to place the Pretender
on the throne; but the measures taken by the
British government defeated the project. The
journals of this period speak highly of the condition
of the British army, particularly the <em>cavalry</em>,
which they represent as the <em>best in the world</em>.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1718</div>

<p>In the spring of 1718 the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
marched into quarters in Yorkshire and Lancashire;
and, the King of Sweden having been compelled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>to relinquish his projected expedition, the
establishment was reduced to two hundred and
seven officers and men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1719</div>

<p>The peace of Europe was disturbed in 1719 by
Philip V. of Spain, who was desirous of recovering
the places ceded by him in the treaty of Utrecht;
and among the measures contemplated by the
Spaniards was placing the Pretender on the throne
of Great Britain, that the interest of this country
might be insured in favour of the projected innovations.
An expedition, commanded by the Duke
of Ormond, was prepared in Spain for a descent
on the British coast; but the fleet was dispersed
and disabled by a storm: two ships, however,
reached the coast of Scotland, and between three
and four hundred Spaniards landed, and were
joined by a number of Highlanders. When information
of this event reached London, orders
were issued for the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> to proceed
with all possible expedition to Scotland, where
they arrived in May. Major-General Wightman
advanced with a body of foot and three troops of the
Scots greys, and attacked the Spaniards and Highlanders
on the 10th of June at the pass of <em>Glenshill</em>,
and forced them to retire with considerable
loss. On the following day the Highlanders dispersed,
and the Spaniards surrendered themselves
prisoners of war. The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> returned
to England in July, and were quartered in
Yorkshire; and a detachment was ordered to embark
at Portsmouth and accompany the expedition
commanded by their colonel, <span class="smcap">Viscount Cobham</span>,
intended to make an attack on Corunna. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
design on that place was, however, abandoned;
but the troops effected a landing on the coast of
Spain, and took <em>Vigo</em>, where they obtained possession
of several pieces of brass ordnance, with a
magazine of muskets and other arms. <em>Rondendella</em>
and <em>Pont-a-Vedra</em> were also taken, and additional
captures of military stores effected. The Spanish
court made overtures for a treaty of peace;
and in November the expedition returned to England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1720</div>

<p>In February, 1720, His Majesty issued a regulation,
fixing the amount of purchase-money to be
paid for regimental commissions, and the following
prices were established for the</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> left Yorkshire in April,
1721, and were stationed at Nottingham and
Derby; and on the 10th of that month the colonelcy
was conferred on <span class="smcap">Sir Charles Hotham</span>,
Baronet, Viscount Cobham having been removed
to the second horse, now first dragoon
guards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1722<br />1723</div>

<p>During the summer of 1722 the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
were encamped near Durham; and on the
12th of January, 1723, the colonelcy, having become
vacant by the decease of Sir Charles Hotham,
was conferred on Brigadier-General <span class="smcap">Humphrey
Gore</span>, from the tenth dragoons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1724<br />1725<br />1726</div>

<p>The regiment occupied extensive quarters in
Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire in 1724; in the
following year it furnished detachments to assist
the revenue officers in their duties on the coast;
and in October, 1726, it was stationed in Sussex
and Essex.</p>

<p>England having agreed to furnish ten thousand
men to assist the States-General in their war with
the Emperor of Germany, the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
were augmented to nine troops, of five hundred
and fifty-two officers and men, and selected to
form part of this force. No embarkation was,
however, required.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1727<br />1728</div>

<p>The decease of King George I. took place on the
11th of June, 1727; and a few days previous to the
coronation of his successor, George II., the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> marched into quarters near London,
and were reviewed in brigade with Honeywood's
(now eleventh) dragoons by his Majesty on Hounslow
Heath, on the 17th of October. They subsequently
proceeded into Leicestershire and Derbyshire;
and in the beginning of the succeeding
year the establishment was again reduced to six
troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1730<br />1731<br />1732<br />1733</div>

<p>In the spring of 1730 the regiment marched
into cantonments in Worcestershire and Gloucestershire;
in 1731 it was stationed in Kent, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
detachments on coast duty; and in the month of
March in the following year proceeded into Somersetshire,
from whence it detached, in the
spring of 1733, several parties to the maritime
towns and villages on the Suffolk coast, where
frequent rencounters took place between the military
and smugglers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1734<br />1735<br />1737<br />1738</div>

<p>The several detachments were collected in May,
1734, and the six troops assembled at Taunton,
where they were reviewed by their colonel, Major-General
Gore. One troop was afterwards
detached into Sussex; and in August another
troop proceeded to Bath, and furnished a daily
guard for the Princess Amelia during her Royal
Highness's residence at that city. In August,
1735, the five troops in Somersetshire marched to
the north, and were placed under the orders of
Lieut.-General Wade, commander-in-chief in
Scotland. They, however, returned to England
in April, 1737, and were quartered in Lancashire;
and during the summer of the following
year the six troops were stationed in Essex and
Kent, with detachments on coast duty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1739</div>

<p>In July, 1739, the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were
ordered to call in their detachments and march
into quarters at Hounslow and its vicinity; and
on the 28th of that month they were reviewed on
Hounslow Heath by his Majesty. In the beginning
of August they marched into quarters in
Worcestershire; and their colonel, Major-General
Gore, died on the 18th of that month. On
the 1st of September his Majesty conferred the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
colonelcy on <span class="smcap">Charles</span>, second <span class="smcap">Duke of Marlborough</span>,
from the 38th regiment of foot.</p>

<p>The Spaniards having repeatedly violated the
existing treaties in regard to the commerce of
England with America, his Majesty declared war
against Spain; and the establishment of the
<span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> was augmented to four hundred
and thirty-five officers and men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1740</div>

<p>In May, 1740, the colonelcy, vacant by the
removal of the Duke of Marlborough to the
second troop (now second regiment) of life
guards, was conferred on Major-General <span class="smcap">Hawley</span>,
from the thirteenth dragoons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1741</div>

<p>During the summer of 1740 the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
were encamped (with three other regiments
of cavalry and six of infantry) near Newbury, and
afterwards near Devizes, under the orders of General
Wade. In October they marched from
camp into quarters in Leicestershire; and in
November, 1741, removed into Somersetshire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1742</div>

<p>In the mean time hostilities had commenced on
the continent, and France, Bavaria, and Prussia
were endeavouring to deprive the house of Austria
of its hereditary dominions. King George II. resolved
to support the Austrians; and in the summer
of 1742 his Majesty sent Field Marshal the
Earl of Stair with sixteen thousand men to Flanders.
The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were selected for
this service, and, having been reviewed by his
Majesty on Hounslow Heath, they embarked in
August, and after their arrival in Flanders were
stationed in the cavalry barracks at Ghent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1743</div>

<p>Leaving Ghent in February, 1743, the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> marched for Germany; and in June
they were encamped, with the other forces, near
Aschaffenburg, on the river Maine, where they
were joined by King George II. and the Duke
of Cumberland. On the 26th of June the army
marched for Hanau, a town of Hesse-Cassel, and
the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> formed part of the advance-column.
When on the march the French
were discovered in position near <em>Dettingen</em>: his
Majesty commanded the army to form opposite
the enemy, and the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were
posted near the right of the line.</p>

<p>The French advanced from their position and
attacked the left of the allied army; the contest
soon became general, and the English cavalry engaged
the French cuirassiers with varied success.
The <span class="smcap">Mousquetaires Noirs</span>, a choice corps of
French cavalry, separated themselves from their
line, and, passing between two columns of infantry,
rushed headlong towards the British cavalry.
The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>, undaunted by
this audacity, met the French horsemen with
a cool, determined bearing, and, encountering
them in mid-onset, overthrew the presumptuous
squadrons, cut them down with a dreadful
slaughter, and captured a <span class="fs70">STANDARD</span>. The <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> were afterwards engaged with the
enemy's household troops; they were again victorious,
and, though without armour, fought and
triumphed over their steel-clad opponents, and
received the thanks of his Majesty for their gallant
conduct. Eventually the French army was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
overthrown, and driven from the field with great
loss.</p>

<p>In this action the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> had six
men and thirty-four horses killed and wounded.
The <span class="smcap">Standard</span> of the <span class="smcap">Mousquetaires Noirs</span>
was taken by a serjeant of the right squadron.
It was of white satin, embroidered with gold and
silver: in the middle a bunch of nine arrows tied
with a wreath, with the motto <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alterius Jovis altera
tela</i>. The lance was broken, the standard
was stained with blood; the cornet who carried it
was killed without falling, being buckled to his
horse, and his standard buckled to him.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> passed the night near
the field of battle, exposed to a heavy storm of
rain, and on the following day marched with the
army to Hanau, and encamped on the banks of
the river Kinzig, where they remained until the
early part of August, when they advanced, and,
having crossed the Rhine above Mentz, were employed
in operations in West Germany. Nothing
of importance, however, transpired; and in October
they commenced their march for Mentz, where
they repassed the Rhine, and, proceeding through
the duchy of Nassau, the principality of Liege,
and province of Brabant, entered Flanders, and,
arriving at Ghent on the 18th of November, again
occupied part of the cavalry barrack at that place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1744</div>

<p>The campaign of 1744 passed without any general
engagement. The army penetrated the
French territory; but the services of the <span class="smcap">Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Dragoons</span> were limited to piquets, out-guards,
and protecting foraging parties from the attacks
of the French garrisons; and in October they
returned to their former station at Ghent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1745</div>

<p>In April, 1745, the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> marched
from their winter quarters, and encamped near
Brussels. The enemy assembled a numerous
army, and invested <em>Tournay</em>, the chief town of
a district in the province of Hainault; and the
Duke of Cumberland, though inferior to the
French in numbers by above thirty thousand men,
resolved to attack them. His Royal Highness
accordingly advanced; and on the 10th of May
(N.S.) a squadron of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> was
engaged, with other forces, in driving in the
enemy's out-guards and piquets. The French
army was discovered in order of battle on a gentle
ascent protected by batteries, and rising gradually
from the plain near <em>Fontenoy</em>. At daybreak on
the morning of the 11th of May the allies moved
forward, but, having many defiles to pass, the
attack did not commence until near ten o'clock.
The British infantry advanced against the enemy,
and throughout the day they displayed the greatest
valour and intrepidity; but the Dutch did not
evince equal resolution, and their failure occasioned
the most unfortunate results. It was near
the conclusion of the action before the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> were called upon to charge, when
they advanced through a hollow way abounding
with difficulties, and were exposed to the destructive
fire of two batteries: they charged by alternate
squadrons with all the spirit and resolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
which characterizes the attack of British cavalry.
But the Duke of Cumberland, perceiving that,
from the failure of the Dutch and other causes,
it was impossible to retrieve the fortune of the
day, ordered a retreat, and the army marched
from the field of battle, and encamped near Aeth.</p>

<p>The loss of the regiment in this engagement
was fifteen men and sixty-nine horses killed; with
Lieutenant-Colonel Naizon, Cornets Hartwell,
Desmeret, and Creighton, thirty-one men, and
forty-seven horses wounded.</p>

<p>The allied army afterwards encamped on the
plain of the Dender, near Lessines; and subsequently
near Brussels.</p>

<p>In the mean time Charles Edward, eldest son of
the Pretender, arrived in Scotland with a ship
laden with arms, and, being joined by several of
the Highland clans, took the opportunity of the
King's army being abroad to make a desperate
effort to gain the throne. Several regiments were
immediately ordered to England; and in November
the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> marched to Williamstadt,
in North Brabant, and embarked; but the
shipping was delayed for some time by contrary
winds, and several horses were lost from the transports
being stranded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1746</div>

<p>After their arrival in England the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
formed part of the army assembled near
the metropolis to repel the threatened descent of a
French force on the southern coast of the kingdom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1747<br />1748</div>

<p>The rebellion having been suppressed by the victory
at Culloden, the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> continued
in the south of England: they were stationed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Windsor, Reading, and Colnbrook, and had the
honour of furnishing travelling escorts for the
royal family: in July, 1746, one troop attended
the Princess Caroline at Bath. On the 26th of
December, 1747, they were reviewed by His Majesty
on Hounslow Heath: in the following summer
they were employed on coast duty in Lincolnshire,
and in suppressing riots among the weavers
in Lancashire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1749<br />1750</div>

<p>After the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle the establishment
was reduced to two hundred and eighty-five
officers and men; and in 1750 the regiment
marched to Scotland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1751</div>

<p>A regulation was issued in 1751 relative to the
clothing and standards of the several regiments;
from which the following particulars have been
extracted relative to the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1752<br />1753<br />1754</div>

<p>In 1752 the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> returned to
England, and were stationed at York, from
whence they marched, in October, 1753, into
quarters in Norfolk and Essex, and in September
of the following year they proceeded into extensive
cantonments in Kent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1755</div>

<p>Disputes having occurred between England and
France relating to the boundaries of the British
possessions in North America, hostilities commenced
in 1755, when an augmentation of one
hundred men was made to the establishment: a
<em>light troop</em>, consisting of three officers, one quarter-master,
two serjeants, three corporals, two drummers,
and sixty private soldiers,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> was raised and
added to the regiment on the same principle as the
light companies to regiments of infantry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1756<br />1757</div>

<p>War was declared against France in 1756,
when the French monarch made preparations for
a descent on the British coast, and the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> were stationed in the maritime towns
in the southern counties: during the summer of
1757 they were encamped near Salisbury.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1758</div>

<p>The British military establishment having been
considerably augmented, His Majesty was prepared
to act offensively against France; and in
1758 the <em>light troop</em> of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
formed part of an expedition commanded by
Charles, Duke of Marlborough, which landed on
the coast of Brittany and destroyed the French
shipping and magazines at <em>St. Maloes</em>. This
troop was afterwards engaged in a second expedition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
to the coast of France, commanded by General
Bligh, when a landing was effected in the Bay
des Marées, and <em>Cherbourg</em> was taken: it was
also engaged in the second descent on the coast of
Brittany.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1759<br />1760</div>

<p>On the 5th of April, 1759, the colonelcy, having
become vacant by the decease of General Hawley,
was conferred on <span class="smcap">Henry Seymour Conway</span>,
from the fourth Irish horse, now seventh dragoon
guards. In the same year the establishment of
each of the six heavy troops was augmented to
sixty private men, and the light troop to eighty-nine;
making a total of five hundred and forty-four
officers and men; and in the following year the
light troop was further augmented to four officers,
one quarter-master, four serjeants, four corporals,
two drummers, and one hundred and eighteen private
men.</p>

<p>In the mean time a British army had proceeded
to Germany, and was serving in conjunction with
the Hanoverian, Hessian, and Brunswick troops,
commanded by Prince Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick;
and in the spring of 1760 the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>,
commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel <span class="smcap">James
Johnston</span>,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> embarked for foreign service, and,
having landed at Bremen, in Lower Saxony, on
the 16th and 17th of April, joined the army encamped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
near Fritzlar, in the principality of Lower
Hesse, on the 21st of that month. On the 22nd
they were reviewed by the Duke of Brunswick,
who was pleased to express his approbation of their
appearance.</p>

<p>After much manœuvring and skirmishing, thirty
thousand French troops, commanded by the Chevalier
de Muy, crossed the Dymel to cut off the communication
of the allied army with Westphalia. The
<span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>, with several other corps, were
immediately sent forward to Liebenau, under the
command of the Hereditary Prince of Brunswick,
to secure the bridge across the Dymel; and being
followed by the main body, the Prince advanced to
the vicinity of <em>Warbourg</em>, and reconnoitred the
French forces in position near that place, whom
he resolved to attack on the following day.</p>

<p>At daybreak on the morning of the 31st of July
the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel
<span class="smcap">James Johnston</span>, left their camp on the
heights of Corbeke, and making a detour through
several villages gained the left flank of the French
army. Several other corps having arrived at the
same point, the attack was immediately commenced,
and after a sharp dispute the enemy gave
way and retired upon <em>Warbourg</em>, where he was
again attacked and driven across the Dymel with
great loss. The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> encountered
the French cavalry corps of royal Piedmont, and
acquitted themselves with their accustomed gallantry.
They afterwards charged a corps of Swiss
infantry (the regiment of Planta) with distinguished
bravery, broke its ranks, and after sabring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
many of the men took twenty-one officers and two
hundred soldiers prisoners: many of the Swiss
attempting to escape were drowned in the Dymel.
Three troops of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> formed part
of the force under the Marquis of Granby, which
pursued the enemy across the Dymel and halted
that night on the heights of Wilda: the other
three, having suffered severely in the attack on
the Swiss infantry, remained at Warbourg.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> In a
general order issued on the occasion, Prince Ferdinand
declared that "<span class="smcap">all the British Cavalry
performed prodigies of valour</span>."</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> lost in this action eight
men and twenty-one horses killed; and twelve
men and thirteen horses wounded.</p>

<p>The regiment was subsequently encamped on
the banks of the Dymel, and on the 1st of October
was despatched towards the Lower Rhine,
forming part of a separate corps under the Hereditary
Prince, which invested <em>Wesel</em>, a town in
the duchy of Cleves.</p>

<p>The enemy advanced in force to relieve the
besieged, and encamped, on the 14th of October,
behind the convent of <em>Campen</em>. Immediately
after dark on the evening of the same day, the
<span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> and other corps advanced towards
the enemy, the Hereditary Prince designing
to surprise him in the night; but it was found necessary
to dislodge a corps which occupied the
convent of <em>Campen</em>, and this occasioned some
firing, which alarmed the French camp, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
troops were immediately formed in order of
battle.</p>

<p>The action commenced before daybreak, and a
succession of attacks, repulses, and charges were
kept up until nine at night, in which the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> took an active part, and they are reported
to have "behaved extremely well." Two
pieces of cannon and a pair of colours were captured;
but at length the Prince perceived that
it was impossible to drive the enemy out of a wood
of which he had possessed himself, and, the allied
infantry having expended all their ammunition,
his Highness ordered a retreat.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> had eight men and ten
horses killed; Lieut.-Colonel Johnston, two men,
and four horses, wounded; Captain Wilson, Lieutenant
Goldsworthy, Cornet Duffe, and twenty-five
men, taken prisoners. The regiment repassed
the Rhine on the 18th of October, and was cantoned
in the principality of Hesse, where the officers
received orders to wear mourning for his late
Majesty King George II.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1761</div>

<p>In February, 1761, the regiment was engaged
in an incursion into the French cantonments, and
took part in several skirmishes with the enemy.
In the spring a remount joined from England.</p>

<p>After much manœuvring, the allied army took
post in Prussian Westphalia, on the rivers Asse
and Lippe, and the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were encamped
on the heights between Illingen and Hohenover.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
On the 15th of July the enemy attacked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the troops under the Marquis of Granby
at <em>Kirch Denkern</em>, when the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
marched across the Asse by the bridge at Hans
Hohenover, and advanced to support the corps
attacked. After a sharp action the enemy was
repulsed with loss. The fire of the skirmishers
was, however, kept up throughout the night, and
on the following morning the enemy renewed the
engagement with great fury. During this day
the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were posted near Vellinghausen,
and, when the enemy's columns of attack
were repulsed, advanced to charge, but were prevented
by the hedges and marshy hollows which
intersected the country. They were subsequently
employed in military operations on the Dymel,
and afterwards marched into the electorate of
Hanover, and were engaged in a skirmish near
<em>Eimbeck</em> in the early part of November. On the
same night they marched through a heavy snow
to <em>Foorwohle</em>, where they encountered and drove
back some French cavalry. On the 9th of November
they had another skirmish at <em>Foorwohle</em>,
and subsequently marched into quarters in East
Friesland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1762</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> left their winter quarters
in May, 1762, and on the 18th of June joined
the army encamped at Brackel, in the bishopric
of Paderborn, from whence they marched to the
heights of Tissel. The French army, commanded
by Marshals d'Estrées and Soubise, took post
at <em>Groebenstien</em>, where Prince Ferdinand resolved
to attack them on the 24th of June, and the army
was ordered to move forward in several columns
for that purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Moving from their camp-ground at daybreak,
the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> passed the Dymel at Liebenau
about four in the morning, and advanced
against the enemy's camp. The manœuvre was
conducted with such address, that the army was
in presence of the French before they had the
least apprehension of an attack, and, being instantly
assaulted in front, flank, and rear, they
retired in confusion, leaving all their equipage
behind them. The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> had advanced
against the enemy's front, and they were
subsequently employed in surrounding a division
of the French army commanded by General
Stainville in the woods of <em>Wilhelmsthal</em>, where
several corps were made prisoners. The pursuit
was continued, and the French took refuge under
the cannon of Cassel; the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> then
retired a few miles, and encamped near Holtzhausen.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the campaign the
<span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were employed in operations
on the Fulde, the Eder, and the Lahn, which
were attended with such signal success, that a
considerable portion of territory was wrested from
the power of the enemy, and the allies took Cassel.</p>

<p>These successes were followed by a treaty of
peace, and the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> proceeded into
quarters in the bishopric of Munster.</p>

<p>At the close of the military operations of the
year, when the army marched into winter quarters,
Colonel <span class="smcap">James Johnston</span>, of the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span>, who had commanded the regiment
since the 7th of April, 1759, and during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
campaign of 1762 had commanded the brigade
composed of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> and second dragoon
guards, received a most flattering mark of the
approbation of the Hereditary Prince of Brunswick
(afterwards reigning Duke, who married
Princess Augusta, sister to George III.; he died
of the wounds he received at the battle of Jena in
1808), namely, a valuable gold snuff-box, embellished
with highly-chased military trophies, accompanied
by an autograph letter, of which the
following is a copy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">1763</div>

<p>During the winter shipping arrived from England
to convey the troops home. The <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> commenced their march for Williamstadt
in February, 1763, and embarked at that
port for England. According to the official returns,
the strength of the regiment was fourteen
officers, three hundred and twenty-nine men, and
four hundred and twenty-three horses, with twenty-four
servants and thirty-five women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>After their return from Germany the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> were ordered to proceed to Scotland;
at the same time the light troop was disbanded,
and the establishment was reduced to two hundred
and thirty-one officers and soldiers. Eight men
per troop were equipped as light dragoons, and
mounted on small horses for skirmishing and other
light services; the remainder of the regiment was
mounted on large horses of superior weight and
power.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1764</div>

<p>In 1764 the regiment marched to South Britain;
and an order was received to remount with
long-tailed horses. On the 9th of May in the
same year the colonelcy was conferred on <span class="smcap">Henry
Earl of Pembroke</span>, who had recently distinguished
himself in the campaigns in Germany.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1766<br />1767<br />1768<br />1769<br />1770<br />1771<br />1772<br />1773</div>

<p>The six drummers borne on the establishment
were, in 1766, ordered to be replaced by trumpeters;
and on the 4th of May in the following
year King George III. reviewed the regiment in
Hyde Park, and expressed his approbation of its
appearance and high state of discipline.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> After
the review it marched to the north of England;
and in 1769 was stationed in Scotland; but returned
to England in the following year, and, after
occupying various quarters in the southern and
western counties, was again reviewed by his Majesty
on the 17th of May, 1773, on Finchley Common;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and, according to the journals of that period,
its excellent condition and correct manœuvring
procured the approbation of the King, and excited
the admiration of the princes, noblemen, general
officers, and other spectators.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1774<br />1775<br />1777</div>

<p>During the summer the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
again proceeded to the north, and, after occupying
quarters for a short period in Yorkshire, marched
to Scotland, where they were stationed during the
summer of 1774; but returned to England in the
succeeding year; and on the 24th of May, 1777,
were reviewed in brigade with the second dragoon
guards, on Wimbledon Common, by the King,
accompanied by several of the young princes, and
attended by a retinue of noblemen and general
officers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1778</div>

<p>Hostilities having commenced between Great
Britain and the colonies in North America, an
augmentation was made in the strength of the
regular army; and in 1778 six serjeants, six corporals,
and one hundred and twenty-six private
men were added to the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>. During
the summer they were encamped, with several
other corps, on Coxheath, near Maidstone, where
they were reviewed by the King.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1779</div>

<p>In 1779 the men of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>,
equipped as light dragoons, with the light troops
of the third dragoon guards, and sixth and eleventh
dragoons, were incorporated into a regiment which
was numbered the twentieth light dragoons.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
During the summer the third dragoon guards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Royals</span>, fifteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first
dragoons were encamped on Lexden Heath, near
Colchester.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1780<br />1781<br />1783</div>

<p>During the great riots in London in 1780 the
<span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were ordered to march thither.
In the following year they proceeded to Scotland;
and at the termination of the American war, in
1783, the establishment was reduced to two hundred
and thirty-one officers and soldiers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1784<br />1789<br />1790<br />1791</div>

<p>The regiment left Scotland in 1784, and occupied
various quarters in the western and northern
counties of England six years. On the breaking
out of the revolutionary proceedings in France,
the establishment was augmented nine men per
troop, and in the spring of 1790 the six troops
proceeded to Scotland; they, however, returned
to England in the following year, and were employed
in suppressing riots at Birmingham.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1792<br />1793</div>

<p>A further augmentation was made to the establishment
in 1792, and again in the spring of
1793, when four troops were ordered to be held
in constant readiness for foreign service.</p>

<p>The enormities committed by the French republicans
occasioned another war; Holland was attacked;
a body of British troops was sent to assist
the Dutch; and on the 10th of June, 1793, four
troops of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> embarked for the
Netherlands to join the army commanded by his
Royal Highness the Duke of York. After landing
at Ostend the four troops marched up the country,
and formed part of the force which drove a body
of French from the <em>Camp de Cæsar</em>, behind the
Scheldt, on the 8th of August. The <span class="smcap">Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Dragoons</span> were also with the covering army during
the siege of Dunkirk, and after the attempt on
that place was abandoned, they were employed in
operations near the frontiers of Flanders, where
they had a sharp encounter with a corps of French
cavalry on the 27th of October.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1794</div>

<p>On the 28th of January, 1794, the colonelcy of
the regiment, being vacant by the decease of the
Earl of Pembroke, was conferred on Major-General
<span class="smcap">Philip Goldsworthy</span>.</p>

<p>In April the four troops on foreign service were
assembled with the army near Cateau, and were
engaged in the general attack made on the enemy's
positions at <em>Prémont</em>, &amp;c. on the 17th of April,
when Captain-Lieutenant the Honourable Thomas
Carlton, of the regiment, was killed. The siege
of Landrécies was immediately undertaken: the
<span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> formed part of the covering
army, and on the 24th of April were engaged in
an affair with the enemy at <em>Villers en Couché</em>,
when the French lost twelve hundred men and
three pieces of cannon: the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> had one man
and two horses killed, and two men and three
horses wounded.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> had another opportunity
of distinguishing themselves on the 26th of April
at <em>Cateau</em>. The enemy had marched out of Cambray,
and at daybreak attacked the British army.
The Duke of York detached the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> and
seven other cavalry regiments to turn the left flank
of the French army: this movement was attended
with the most brilliant success; the enemy was
overthrown with immense slaughter; the rout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
became general&mdash;cavalry and infantry, mingled in
promiscuous crowds, were scattered over the plains,
and the fugitives fell beneath the sabres of the
British dragoons, who captured the French commander,
Lieut.-General Chapuy, and thirty-five
pieces of cannon. The Duke of York, in his
account of this action, observes, "<span class="smcap">The behaviour
of the British cavalry has been beyond
all praise</span>." The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were
among the corps which were declared in general
orders to have "<span class="fs70">ACQUIRED IMMORTAL HONOUR</span>."
Their loss on this occasion was six men and
twelve horses killed; with Lieutenant Froom,
two serjeants, eleven men, and fourteen horses
wounded.</p>

<p>After the capture of <em>Landrécies</em> the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> marched to the vicinity of <em>Tournay</em>,
where they were again engaged with the enemy
on the 10th of May; and the Duke of York observed
in his public despatch, that the troops had
"well supported the reputation acquired on the
26th of last month." The loss of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>
was only two horses killed, and one man and three
horses wounded.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were in reserve when the attack
was made on the French positions on the 17th of
May. The army afterwards resumed its post before
<em>Tournay</em>, where it was attacked on the 22d of
May by General Pichegru with an immense force.
The British heavy cavalry had, it appears, become
a terror to the enemy, for Brown, in his Journal,
observes (22d May), "A column of five or six
thousand men made its appearance towards our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
left, on which account the brigade of guards and
the British heavy cavalry remained ready for
action on their camp ground; but the French,
observing our advantageous situation, <em>and dreading
the thought of meeting the British cavalry
a second time on an open plain</em>, thought proper
not to approach." Finally the French were
repulsed at every point of attack, and retreated in
the evening.</p>

<p>At length the enemy defeated the Austrians, and
brought forward such immense numbers that the
English army had no chance of success: the Duke
of York retreated, and the final evacuation of
Flanders followed.</p>

<p>In the mean time another squadron of the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span> embarked for foreign service; but having
been driven back by severe weather, the officers
and men were ordered to disembark and remain
in England. In July that part of the regiment
which was in England marched from Salisbury
to Weymouth, in consequence of his Majesty visiting
that place; and in October, when the King
returned to London, they marched to Dorchester
barracks.</p>

<p>During the winter the four troops on foreign
service were exposed to privations and inclement
weather, which occasioned the death of many men
and horses. The winter was particularly severe,
the Dutch people were favourable to the French,
and the British troops, in their retreat through
Holland during a hard frost and storms of snow
and sleet, were treated as enemies by the inhabitants;
at length the troops arrived in the duchy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of Bremen, where they had repose and kind treatment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1795</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were not engaged in
any further hostilities on the continent. During
the summer of 1795 they were encamped on one
of the plains of Westphalia, and in the winter
embarked for England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1796</div>

<p>Meanwhile, that part of the regiment which
was on home service was again employed on
King's duty at Weymouth, during his Majesty's
stay at that place, and afterwards proceeded to
Dorchester, where the four troops returning from
the continent arrived in January, 1796. In July
of the same year the regiment encamped on Barham
Downs, near Weymouth, and in September
marched into quarters at Canterbury.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1797<br />1798<br />1799</div>

<p>In October, 1797, the regiment marched for
Birmingham and Coventry; in July, 1798, for
Exeter and Taunton; and in the following summer
proceeded to Radipole barracks, Weymouth;
but marched from thence, in November of the same
year, for Salisbury, Warminster, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In August, orders were received for the regiment
to be mounted on nag-tailed black horses;<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
and the horse's tails were consequently cut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1800</div>

<p>During the summer of 1800 an encampment of
about thirty thousand men was formed on Swinley
common, near Windsor; the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
joined the camp in July; the troops were frequently
exercised in the presence of the royal
family, and the King reviewed the several corps
previous to their departure. On the 11th of August
the regiment quitted the camp, and proceeded
to Croydon barracks and Epsom, with a squadron
detached on coast duty in Sussex.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1801</div>

<p>On the 7th of January, 1801, his Majesty conferred
the colonelcy of the regiment on Major-General
<span class="smcap">Thomas Garth</span>, in succession to Lieut.-General
Goldsworthy, deceased.</p>

<p>Towards the end of May the regiment marched
to Canterbury, and furnished numerous detachments
on the revenue duty at the maritime towns
and villages on the coast of Kent, where they assisted
in making large seizures of smuggled goods,
for which they received a reward of upwards of
one pound per man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1802</div>

<p>A treaty of peace with the French republic
having been signed at Amiens, a reduction of two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
troops was made in the establishment, and the officers
were placed on half-pay.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1803</div>

<p>In July, 1802, four troops were ordered to
Trowbridge to aid the civil power in the suppression
of riots. In October following the regiment
proceeded to Exeter and Taunton, with detached
troops on coast duty in Cornwall; and in
April, 1803, it was removed to Dorchester,
Radipole, and Wareham barracks, from whence
it marched in July following to Arundel and
Chichester. At the same time, the war with
France having recommenced, the establishment
was augmented from eight to ten troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1804</div>

<p>A change of quarters took place in April, 1804,
and the regiment was stationed at Ipswich and
Woodbridge; from whence it proceeded, in November
following, to Colchester, where it passed
the winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1805<br />1806</div>

<p>The regiment quitted Colchester in April, 1805,
and proceeded to York, Newcastle-on-Tyne, and
Birmingham. In January, 1806, it returned from
the north, and was again stationed at Woodbridge;
and in March of the same year it once
more proceeded northward, and, on arriving in
Scotland, its head-quarters were established at
Edinburgh, with detached troops at Dunbar,
Haddington, and Perth, having marched upwards
of six hundred miles in three months.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1807<br />1808</div>

<p>Embarking from Scotland in January, 1807,
the regiment proceeded to Ireland, from which
country it had been absent one hundred and fifteen
years; and on its arrival the head-quarters
were stationed at Dundalk, with detached troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
at Belturbet, Lisburn, Monaghan, Enniskillen,
Sligo, and Londonderry. In June, 1808, it proceeded
to Dublin, with detached troops at Carlow
and Athy.</p>

<p>In the mean time important events had transpired
in the Peninsula. Napoleon Buonaparte
(whom the French had elevated to the throne)
had obtained possession of the kingdoms of Portugal
and Spain by treachery; had placed his
brother Joseph on the throne of Spain, and supported
these usurpations by an immense French
army. The Spaniards and Portuguese, being
impatient of the bondage into which they were
brought, made energetic struggles for liberty, and,
a British force proceeding to their aid, Portugal
was delivered from the power of Buonaparte.
Lieut.-General Sir John Moore advanced from
Lisbon into Spain to aid the patriots; and the
<span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were directed to proceed on
foreign service to reinforce the army in the Peninsula;
but, on arriving at Cork for embarkation,
news of the result of Sir John Moore's
expedition occasioned the order to be countermanded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809</div>

<p>The regiment remained at Cork barracks until
April, 1809, when it proceeded into extensive cantonments
(head-quarters at Clonmell), from whence
it was withdrawn in August following, and eight
troops, of eighty rank and file and eighty horses per
troop, embarked at Cork for Portugal. The transports
sailed on the 2nd of September, and on the
12th and 13th of that month the regiment landed
at Lisbon, and occupied the barracks at Belem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1810</div>

<p>The British army in Portugal, commanded by
Lord Wellington, was occupying quarters on the
Mondego. The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> marched a
few stages up the country in January, 1810, and
were stationed at Santarem and Torres Novas, in
the province of Estremadura; from whence they
marched, in February, to Niza and Alphalo, in
the Alentejo.</p>

<p>The enemy having an immense superiority of
numbers, the British commander was reduced to
the necessity of acting on the defensive, and his
ultimate object was the protection of Lisbon.
He, however, resolved to maintain a frontier position
as long as possible; and, Ciudad Rodrigo
being menaced in the end of April, the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> were ordered to advance to Belmonte,
in the province of Beira, where they arrived on
the 5th of May. The French army, commanded
by Marshal Massena, Prince of Esling, proved so
numerous, that all hope of preserving Ciudad
Rodrigo was abandoned. The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
left Belmonte on the 9th of June, and proceeded
to Villa Velha, from whence they marched,
on the 1st of July, to Ville de Touro, and towards
the end of the same month to Alverca; the
enemy having taken Ciudad Rodrigo and besieged
Almeida, the advanced posts of the British army
were removed to <em>Frexadas</em>.</p>

<p>The French took Almeida on the 27th of August,
and on the following day attacked a squadron
of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> and a squadron of the fourteenth
light dragoons on piquet at <em>Frexadas</em>,
under the command of Major Dorville. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
enemy brought forward a superior force of cavalry,
supported by infantry; but the two British
squadrons, undaunted by superior numbers,
charged the French horsemen with signal gallantry,
and drove them from the field with the
loss of many men killed and wounded, and five
taken prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> lost, in this encounter,
two men and one horse killed, and two
men and one horse wounded.</p>

<p>The allied army retired a short distance. The
<span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> continued to be actively employed,
and, in a skirmish with the enemy on the
2nd of September at <em>Alverca</em>, on the main road
to Almeida, they had a serjeant wounded. The
regiment retired from its advanced position on the
same day, and on the 19th of that month was stationed
at Santa Comba Dão.</p>

<p>The enemy continued to press upon the rear of
the British army, and a party of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
had another encounter with the French on
the 21st of September, and had one man wounded,
and another wounded and taken prisoner.</p>

<p>Lord Wellington having resolved to make a
stand on the heights of <em>Busaco</em>, the army retired
to that position, covered by the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> and fourteenth
light dragoons. During the severe contest
in the mountains on the 27th of September, the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span> were formed in reserve behind the position;
and when the army retired to the celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
lines of <em>Torres Vedras</em>, the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> once more
occupied the post of honour in the rear of the line
of march. The French pressing upon the retiring
army near <em>Pombal</em> on the 5th of October, their
audacity was punished by a piquet of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>
commanded by Lieutenant Carden, who charged
the enemy and drove them back with loss; but,
having advanced too far in pursuit, the lieutenant
and one man, who were both wounded, were
taken prisoners: the piquet, however, captured
and brought off a French cavalry officer. The
enemy's leading corps, being supported by immense
columns, continued to hover round the rear
of the allied army; and the temerity of their cavalry
was again chastised on the 9th of October,
near <em>Quinta de Torre</em>, by a squadron of the
<span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>, which made a gallant charge,
driving the French horsemen back with loss, and
forcing them to take shelter behind a corps of infantry.
This corps was too strong to be attacked
by the squadron, and the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, having received
a volley, retired with the loss of six horses killed,
and one serjeant-major and two men wounded,
with four men wounded and taken prisoners.</p>

<p>On the following day the allied army was in
position in the fortified lines, where it opposed to
the advance of the enemy a barrier so formidable
that Marshal Massena, after several reconnoisances,
declined to attack it, and retired during the night
of the 14th of November. On the 15th the
<span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were despatched after the
enemy, and a piquet of the regiment took a serjeant
and five French dragoons prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>The French army took post on the heights of
Santarem; and the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were stationed
at Cazal Diera, Quinta, St. Christol, and
Porto de Mugem, from whence they sent out
detachments on piquet and outpost duty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1811</div>

<p>The French Marshal, having consumed his resources
and wasted the numbers and physical
power of his army, retired from Santarem on the
night of the 5th of March, 1811. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span>
were again despatched in pursuit, and in the series
of brilliant exploits which followed they took a
distinguished part. They had a skirmish with
the enemy near <em>Pecoloo</em> on the 7th of March, when
they took three prisoners, and had one man and one
horse wounded. They had another encounter with
the French on the 8th of March, and had two men
and one horse wounded. They again came in
contact with the enemy on the 11th of March,
near <em>Pombal</em>, and took two serjeants and seventy-six
men prisoners.</p>

<p>Resuming the pursuit on the following day the
allies discovered in their front a body of French
cavalry, infantry, and artillery, posted on a high
table land near <em>Redinha</em>. Lord Wellington ordered
the troops to form in line, and the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> were directed to support the attack of
the infantry. Three shots from the British centre
was the signal to advance, and suddenly a most
splendid spectacle of war was exhibited. The
woods seemed alive with troops, and in a few
moments thirty thousand men, forming three lines
of battle, were stretched across the plain, bending
in a gentle curve, and moving majestically onwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
while the horsemen and guns, springing
forward simultaneously from the centre and left
wing, charged under a general volley from the
French battalions: the latter were instantly hidden
by the smoke, and when that had cleared away, no
enemy was to be seen, the French having made a
precipitate retreat to Condeixa.</p>

<p>The British again moved forward in pursuit, and
on the 14th of March the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> supported
a successful attack of the infantry on a
French force posted in the mountains at <em>Casal
Nova</em>: they also supported the attack on the
French position at <em>Foz d'Aronce</em> on the 15th;
and on the 18th they encountered a party of the
enemy near <em>Sernadilla</em>, when they took a serjeant
and twelve men prisoners, and captured twelve
mules: the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> had only one man wounded on
this occasion. They continued hovering near the
French army; and on the 26th of March a patrole
of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, commanded by Lieutenant Foster,
with a patrole of the sixteenth light dragoons,
attacked a detachment of French cavalry near
<em>Alverca</em> with distinguished gallantry, sabred several
dragoons, and took an officer and thirty-seven
men prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> had another affair with a party of
the enemy on the 28th of March, when they captured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
a car laden with officers' baggage near Ardés,
and had one man wounded. On the third of April
they were posted in reserve during the action at
<em>Sabugal</em>; and, on the retreat of the French, they
were detached in pursuit, and captured several
mules laden with baggage near <em>Alfayates</em>.</p>

<p>On the 7th of April the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were sent to
the relief of a corps of Portuguese militia, commanded
by Colonel Trant, who had taken post
near <em>Fort Conception</em>. A brigade of French infantry
was within half a mile of the militia, whose
destruction appeared inevitable, when suddenly
two cannon shots were heard to the southward,&mdash;the
French formed squares in retreat,&mdash;and in a
few minutes six squadrons of British cavalry and
a troop of horse artillery came sweeping up the
plain in their rear. The Portuguese were rescued
from impending danger. The enemy, however,
contrived to effect their escape, with the loss of
about three hundred men killed, wounded, and
taken prisoners, and part of their baggage: among
the other captures the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> took a
drove of fourteen bullocks and a horse.</p>

<p>The French army having been driven out of
Portugal, the allies blockaded <em>Almeida</em>. Marshal
Massena advanced to relieve that place, and he
found the allied army posted on a fine table land,
the left at Fort Conception, and the right at the
beautiful village of <em>Fuentes d'Onor</em>. The village
was attacked on the 3rd of May, and on the
5th a general assault was made on the British
army. The French drove in the cavalry out-guards,
and by the impetuosity of their attacks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
gained some advantage; when two squadrons of
the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel
<span class="smcap">Clifton</span>, made a gallant and successful charge on
the enemy's cavalry, took a serjeant and twenty-three
men, and released a party of the foot guards
who had been made prisoners by the French. A
party of the enemy's cavalry made a gallant charge,
and captured two guns belonging to Captain Bull's
troop of horse artillery; when a squadron of the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span> dashed forward, routed the enemy, and
retook the guns, which they brought back to the
British line, with several French prisoners. Finally,
the French were repulsed at every point of
attack, and forced to relinquish their design of
relieving <em>Almeida</em>. The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> had
four men and nineteen horses killed; also two serjeants,
thirty-four men, and twenty-four horses
wounded; and they subsequently occupied their
former quarters at Villa de Ceirva.</p>

<p>About midnight on the 10th of May the French
garrison in <em>Almeida</em> blew up the works, then
rushed in one column out of the town, forced their
passage through the blockading troops, and directed
their march on Villa de Ceirva; but finding it
occupied by the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> they changed the direction
of their march and moved on Barba del Puerco. A
party of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> having been suddenly
called out in the night, overtook the rear of the
French column, which they attacked, and took a serjeant
and nine men prisoners. The fourth and thirty-sixth
foot also pursued the enemy; but the main
body of the garrison made good their retreat. The
regiment had two men wounded on this occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>After this affair Lord Wellington proceeded to
Estremadura, to besiege Badajoz: but the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> remained with the forces left on the
frontiers of Portugal, near Ciudad Rodrigo; and
they were stationed in advance to cover the front
from Villa de Egua to Espejo.</p>

<p>The French army, having been reinforced, and
placed under the command of Marshal Marmont,
advanced at daybreak on the morning of the 6th of
June in two columns, when the light division was
directed to retire from Gallegos upon <em>Nave d'Aver</em>,
and subsequently upon Alfayetes; and the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>,
commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel <span class="smcap">Clifton</span>, with
a troop of the fourteenth light dragoons, were
assembled at Gallegos to cover the retreat. The
French brought forward about two thousand cavalry,
six thousand infantry, and ten guns; and
the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> confronted this immense force with a
degree of fortitude and valour seldom equalled.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
That celebrated French cavalry officer, General
Montbrun, manœuvred to outflank the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>;
but his squadrons were attacked and defeated twice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and the retreat was effected with little loss. For
their distinguished conduct on this occasion the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span> were publicly thanked by Lieutenant-General
Sir Brent Spencer, who commanded, in
the absence of Lord Wellington in Estremadura.
They lost on this occasion a troop-serjeant-major,
three men, and six horses killed; and nine men
wounded.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> subsequently bivouacked near
Sabugal, from whence they proceeded to Arronches,
and were encamped at the conflux of the
Caya and Algrette: towards the end of July they
marched to Idanha a Nova, on the frontiers of
Portugal; and in August to Villa de Toura and
Iteura. Meanwhile Lord Wellington returned
from Estremadura, and afterwards blockaded Ciudad
Rodrigo. Marshal Marmont advanced; when
his lordship raised the blockade, and took up a
defensive position, and the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
were posted on the 22nd of September on the
Upper Azava. A series of attacks and manœuvres
followed, and on the 25th the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were in the
position of Fuente Guinaldo: from whence they
were ordered to retire on the following day; and
on the 27th were posted near Alfayates, with a
piquet at <em>Aldea de Ponte</em>, which was attacked by
the enemy, when Lieutenant Ross had his horse
killed under him, and three men and six horses
were wounded. On the following day the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>
were with the army in position behind Soito; and
Lord Wellington offered battle, but the enemy
retired, and the allied army went into cantonments.
The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were stationed at Adão; subsequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
at Espejo, and towards the end of November
marched for Meda.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1812</div>

<p>Lord Wellington having resolved to besiege
<em>Ciudad Rodrigo</em>, the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> marched
to the vicinity of that city in January, 1812, and
took post at Villa Turpina, to cover the troops
employed in the siege. This city was taken by
storm on the 19th of that month, and, when the
works were put in a state of defence, the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>
marched to St. Jao de Presquere. The siege of
<em>Badajoz</em>&mdash;the capital of Spanish Estremadura,
situate on a beautiful plain on the banks of the
Guadiana, was next determined upon: the army
was accordingly put in motion for the south, and
the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>, proceeding by way of
Abrantes into Spanish Estremadura, were placed
under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir
Thomas Graham; and, having crossed the Guadiana
on the 16th of March, advanced upon
Valverde and Santa Martha, and thence towards
Llerena,&mdash;an old town of Estremadura, which once
belonged to the knights of St. John. On the 19th
of March the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were at Villa Franca; but
on the advance of Marshal Soult, with a considerable
force, they retired. <em>Badajoz</em> was taken on
the 6th of April, and Lord Wellington afterwards
proceeded to the north; but the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
remained in Estremadura, forming part of the force
left in the south under the command of Lieutenant-General
Sir Rowland Hill.</p>

<p>On the 25th of May a squadron of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>,
commanded by Major <span class="smcap">Dorville</span>, proceeded on
out-post duty to <em>Llera</em>. On the 27th, at night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the commanding officer ascertained that a French
brigade had advanced within a short distance of his
post: he therefore retired to a wood about a mile
behind the village, and having placed a small piquet
on an eminence, with a support at the ford of a rivulet
in front of the wood, the squadron bivouacked for
the night. In the mean time a brigade of French
cavalry, commanded by Brigadier-General L'Allemand,
advanced to <em>Llera</em>, and surrounded the village
at midnight, expecting to surprise the squadron
in its quarters; but on discovering that it had
marched, he advanced towards the wood, and, attacking
the piquet, wounded and took prisoners
one serjeant and five men. Meanwhile the support
commenced a brisk fire, and gallantly defended the
passage of the ford, and the squadron, not having
drawn bit, immediately mounted and formed;
when the French, being foiled in their object,
retired: the squadron followed, and continued
skirmishing with the enemy until they had passed
<em>Llera</em>, and then resumed its former post.</p>

<p>On the 11th of June the seventeenth and twenty-ninth
regiments of French dragoons, commanded
by Brigadier-General L'Allemand, again proceeded
to the vicinity of <em>Llera</em>, when Major-General
Slade advanced with the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> and third dragoon
guards, and having attacked the French, routed
them, and continued the pursuit about nine miles.
On arriving at the vicinity of <em>Maguilla</em> the British
regiments had another opportunity of charging,
when they broke the enemy's first line, sabred
many of the men, and took one of General L'Allemand's
aides-de-camp prisoner. The British regiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
rushed forward in pursuit with too much
eagerness, each vying with the other which should
most distinguish itself; and in a moment of confusion
the French brought forward a reserve, and
charged the broken squadrons with such fury that
they were obliged to retire.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> lost
in this encounter one serjeant, eleven men, and six
horses killed; also nineteen men, and eight horses
wounded; and Lieutenant Windsor, with four
serjeants and thirty-nine men, taken prisoners.
Lieutenant Windsor and most of the men were
wounded before they were taken.</p>

<p>Patroles were afterwards sent on the road to
<em>Maguilla</em>, and on the 14th of June a serjeant and
twenty-five men of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, with the like
number of the third dragoon guards, encountered
a squadron of French dragoons, which they charged
with distinguished gallantry, and having sabred a
number of men, took a captain (the commanding
officer of the squadron), with a serjeant and twenty
men, prisoners; and captured twenty-three horses.</p>

<p>On the 18th of June the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> marched for
Albuhera: they were subsequently encamped near
Llerena, from whence they marched to Los Santos.
Meanwhile the forces under Lord Wellington had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
defeated the French at <em>Salamanca</em>; and on the
news of this success Lieutenant-General Sir Rowland
Hill advanced. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were in motion
on the 30th of July, and proceeded to Villa Franca,
and subsequently to Fuente del Maestre.</p>

<p>The main army having marched to Madrid, Sir
Rowland Hill advanced to act in concert with
Lord Wellington. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> advanced on the
27th of August, and on the 6th of September were
at Villa Nova; left that place on the 13th of
September; crossed the pontoon bridge at Almarez
on the 19th, and arrived at Talavera, in the valley
of the Tagus, on the 28th; from whence they
proceeded to Tembleque, in New Castile. Lord
Wellington having left Madrid and besieged the
castle of Burgos, Lieutenant-General Sir Rowland
Hill took up a position on the Tagus, and the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span> marched by Aranjuez,&mdash;a beautiful palace
of the kings of Spain,&mdash;to Morata. The
enemy, however, concentrated his forces, and advanced,
with an immense superiority of numbers,
to relieve Burgos, when Lord Wellington raised
the siege and retired, and Lieutenant-General Sir
Rowland Hill made a corresponding movement.
The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> commenced retiring on the 27th of
October by Madrid and the pass of the Guadarama
mountains, and arrived, on the 12th of November,
at Salamanca; from whence they proceeded
on the 15th to <em>Arguilla</em>, and on the 17th had an
encounter with the enemy, when four men and one
horse were wounded. Leaving Arguilla on the
28th of November they proceeded to Zelreira, and
towards the end of December to Alcantara.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1813</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> passed the winter and
spring of 1813 in Spanish Estremadura, from
whence they advanced, in the middle of May, to
turn the enemy's position on the northern bank of
the Douro; and, arriving at Salamanca on the 26th
of that month, they forded the river Tormes above
the town, and encountered a body of French infantry
and a few cavalry under General Villatte,
who was retiring from Salamanca in the direction
of Alba de Tormes, when the right squadron, led
by Lieutenant-Colonel <span class="smcap">Clifton</span>, charged the
enemy with signal gallantry, sabred a number of
men, and took one hundred and forty-three prisoners,
with four tumbrils. In this action the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>
had five horses killed, and ten men and three
horses wounded: Major Purvis's charger was also
killed under him.</p>

<p>After this action the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> bivouacked near
La Orbado until the 3rd of June, when they advanced,
with the army, on Valladolid. The enemy
withdrew his troops from Madrid, and retired
on Burgos; and on the approach of the allied army
blew up the castle and fell back towards the Ebro,
and subsequently to <em>Vittoria</em>, where he prepared
to give battle. The allied army followed in pursuit;
and in this long and toilsome march the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span> were subjected to much fatigue and privation,&mdash;frequently
marching from daybreak in the
morning until dusk in the evening, through a
romantic and difficult tract of country, and climbing
mountains and passing defiles and rugged
precipices heretofore deemed impracticable. The
horses, from practice, ascended and descended the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
mountains with astonishing facility; and on the
20th of June the troops were in front of the
enemy's position.</p>

<p>At daylight on the morning of the 21st of June
the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> left their bivouac, and advanced
to support the attack of the infantry on the
heights in front of <em>Vittoria</em>. The face of the ground
was so rugged that the operations of the cavalry were
impeded, and for some time the services of the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span> were limited to supporting the columns of
attack: towards the evening they, however, advanced
to charge, but the enemy fled in confusion,
leaving behind them cannon, ammunition, baggage,
and the military chest of the army. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span>
moved forward in pursuit, and bivouacked about
three miles beyond <em>Vittoria</em>: their loss was only
one man and two horses killed, and one horse
wounded. On this occasion the regiment was
commanded by Major Purvis, Lieutenant-Colonel
Clifton being in command of the brigade.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> advanced in pursuit of the enemy
on the following morning, and on the 2nd of July
they were at Suista and other villages near <em>Pampeluna</em>,
which place was blockaded by the allied
army. They left that quarter, however, on the
18th of July, for Sanguesa, a town of Navarre, on
the river Arragon, twenty-five miles from <em>Pampeluna</em>.
Towards the end of that month the
French army advanced to relieve <em>Pampeluna</em>,
when the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were immediately ordered to
return to the vicinity of that place, and they were
formed in column at the foot of the mountains during
the battle of the <em>Pyrenees</em>. They remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
with the blockading force near <em>Pampeluna</em> until
the 10th of August, when, forage becoming scarce,
they again proceeded to the plains of the Arragon,
where they remained, together with General Mina's
division of Spaniards, as a corps of reserve
and support to the blockade, until after the surrender
of that fortress. They were subsequently
stationed at Villa Franca during the winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814</div>

<p>In the mean time the main army had entered
France. On the 3rd of February, 1814, the
<span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> marched to Tauste: from
whence they proceeded, in the beginning of March,
through the Pyrenean mountains, and entered
France on the 9th of that month. For a short
period they were stationed near <em>Bayonne</em>, which
place was blockaded by the allied army; but they
subsequently advanced up the country, and on the
10th of April were at the battle of <em>Toulouse</em>, when
they were employed in covering the light brigade
of guns, and in driving the piquets of the enemy
under the walls of the city, which was immediately
besieged. The French, having retired, the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>
were ordered forward to Villa Franche, and afterwards
to Gardouch. These brilliant successes of the
British troops were followed by the abdication of
Buonaparte, and the restoration of peace.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> returned to Villa
Franche on the 23rd of April, where they remained
about a month, and then moved to Montguiscarde;
and on the 2nd of June commenced
their march through France to Calais, where they
arrived on the 17th of July. They embarked on
the following day, landed at Dover on the 19th,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and marched from thence to Bristol, where they
arrived on the 11th of August; and shortly afterwards
the establishment was reduced from ten to
eight troops. In November the quarters were
removed from Bristol to Exeter; and the brilliant
services of the regiment were rewarded with permission
to bear the word "<span class="smcap">Peninsula</span>," as an
honorary distinction, on the standards and appointments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815</div>

<p>The prospect of a lasting peace soon vanished,
and unexpected events brought the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>
again into the field of conflict. The return
of Buonaparte to France, the flight of Louis
XVIII. from Paris, and the appearance of a British
army near the frontiers of France, followed
in rapid succession. An express arrived at the
quarters of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> on the morning of the
24th of April, 1815, with orders to march on the
following morning for Canterbury, and afterwards
to Dover and Ramsgate, and to embark for the
Netherlands. An augmentation of two troops was
at the same time ordered; a hundred horses were
received at Canterbury by transfer from the fifth
dragoon guards; and about the middle of May the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span> were in Belgium, in quarters in the villages
between Ghent and Brussels, where, to pass
away the time unemployed by military duties, the
officers amused themselves with horse-races and
athletic sports.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>On the morning of the 16th of June the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span> were suddenly aroused before daybreak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
by the loud notes of the bugle sounding "to horse."
The summons had a highly exhilarating effect on
the spirits of the men: they turned out with alacrity,
not doubting but the day was big with events,
and in a short time they were advancing on <em>Quatre
Bras</em>, where the enemy had commenced a furious
attack on the advanced-posts. After continuing
the march about fifty miles, the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> arrived at
the scene of conflict about dusk in the evening:<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
the fighting had ceased, and the troops bivouacked
on the field of battle.</p>

<p>The Prussians had been defeated at Ligny and
forced to retire; the Duke of Wellington made a
corresponding movement; and the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>,
after passing the night under arms in the
open fields, were formed in line, on the forenoon of
the 17th of June, with the other cavalry regiments,
to cover the retreat of the infantry. The British
cavalry, manœuvring, and, by their varied evolutions,
masking and covering the retreat of the
infantry, exhibited a splendid spectacle of war.
One squadron of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, commanded by
Major Radclyffe, was sent to the front to skirmish.
"I was detached," observes the major, in his narrative,
"with my squadron to cover the brigade
by skirmishing, and Major-General Sir William
Ponsonby, and the brigade generally, were
pleased to applaud the style in which we acquitted
ourselves. It rained with greater violence
than I ever witnessed before, which I found to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
my advantage when it was my turn to skirmish.
The enemy had two squadrons of Chasseurs
opposed to me, and as they could not overpower
us by their fire, they huzzaed and endeavoured
to excite each other on with 'Vive l'Empereur!'
and once actually charged towards my skirmishers,
but they stopped short, not daring to come
to daggers with us." Towards the evening the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span> arrived at the position in front of <em>Waterloo</em>,
where they halted, and again passed the night
in the open fields, without provisions, without
drink, and exposed to continued rain.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 18th of June the army
was formed in order of battle. "We" (the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>)
"found ourselves," states the Major, in his
journal, "in our place in close column behind the
second line of infantry, fetlock deep in mud; no
baggage for the officers, and neither provision
nor water for the men (though some stray cattle
had been killed and eaten, and a small supply of
spirits had, a short time before, been found on
the road), so that we might be said to go <em>coolly</em>
into action, for every man was wet to the skin."
Notwithstanding these disadvantages the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>
proved "true Britons."</p>

<p>At ten o'clock the French army was seen forming
on the opposite heights, from whence a cloud
of skirmishers rushed forwards: the fire of the
artillery gradually opened, and about noon the columns
of attack came sweeping through the valley
in all the pomp and majesty of war. A succession
of attacks was made at various points, and the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span> were formed in column, awaiting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
moment when their services should be required.
At length, twenty thousand French infantry
(Count d'Erlon's corps) suddenly appeared on the
opposite heights, and rushing forward, such was
the celerity of their course, that, scarcely seeming
to traverse the intermediate space, they quickly
ascended the position,&mdash;dispersed a Belgic brigade
with which they first came in contact,&mdash;forced the
artillery-men, posted in the rear of the double
hedge and narrow road, to abandon their guns,&mdash;broke
through parts of the British supporting
infantry,&mdash;and several thousand of French foot
having passed La Haye Sainte, had actually
crowned the allied position, when Lieutenant-General
the Earl of Uxbridge came galloping
to that part of the field. A few words issued
from his lips: speedily the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, the Scots
Greys, and Inniskillen dragoons were seen advancing
in line; the noble bearing of these distinguished
horsemen was characteristic of the
innate valour of the officers and men, and the spectacle
was singularly imposing. The three regiments
halted a few moments to permit the broken
battalions to pass through the intervals of squadrons,
and then rushed forward, with terrific
violence, upon the enemy's infantry. The effect
was magical: the heads of the French columns
were instantly broken and forced back,&mdash;a general
flight commenced; the firing ceased, and the
smoke having cleared away, those formidable
masses, a moment before so menacing and conspicuous,
had almost disappeared, or left only the
traces of a dispersed rabble flying over the plain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Some, despairing to escape, abandoned their arms,
and threw themselves on the ground, and the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span>, Greys, and Inniskillen dragoons were
seen trampling down and sabring the French infantry
with uncontrollable power. Crowds of
French soldiers appeared at different points, surrendering
as prisoners: many, however, defended
themselves to the last; and others again, rising up,
after being ridden over or passed by the dragoons,
were observed firing on their rear, the slope of
the position being left literally covered with dead.</p>

<p>During the heat of this conflict, Captain <span class="smcap">Alexander
Kennedy Clark</span>,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> commanding the centre
squadron of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>, having led
his men about two hundred yards beyond the
second hedge on the British left, perceived in the
midst of a crowd of infantry the <span class="smcap">Eagle</span> of the
French 105th regiment, with which the bearer
was endeavouring to escape to the rear. Against
this body of men, Captain Clark instantly led his
squadron at full speed, and plunging into the
midst of the crowd, overtook and slew the French
officer who carried the <span class="smcap">Eagle</span>; and several men
of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> coming up at the moment,
the <span class="smcap">Eagle</span> was captured, and Captain Clark,
giving it to Corporal Stiles,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> directed him to carry
it to the rear.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Another <span class="smcap">Eagle</span> was captured by the Greys;
and the three regiments, animated by this tide of
success, pursued their advantage too far. They
crossed the ravine; carried several batteries; and
continued their course even to the rear of the
enemy's position. The latter, recovering confidence
from the disorder too apparent in the movements
of this insulated and unsupported brigade, fell
upon it with a large body of lancers and some
cuirassiers. The three regiments being broken
and dispersed in the pursuit, were forced back,
and they sustained considerable loss. Their gallant
leader, Major-General <span class="smcap">Sir William Ponsonby</span>
was killed,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and the command of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
brigade devolved on Colonel Muter<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> of the Inniskillen
dragoons.</p>

<p>In this attack the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> took an immense
number of prisoners: their conduct excited great
admiration, and has been commended by historians.
The following is an extract from one of the numerous
accounts of the battle of Waterloo:&mdash;"The
Marquis of Anglesey, galloped up to the second
brigade (1st, 2nd, and 6th dragoons), and the
three regiments, wheeling into line, presented a
beautiful front of about one thousand men.
The noble Marquis ordered a charge, which was
most gallantly executed. They took the enemy
in flank and a most tremendous fight commenced.
Every man fought with unparalleled heroism,
for every man had his own individual task to
perform. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, fired with a noble
emulation, rushed into a column of four thousand
men, where they captured the Eagle of the
105th regiment and bore it off in triumph. The
greater part of this column then threw down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
their arms, and were immediately conducted to
the rear. The Greys also captured an Eagle.
Thus the great attack of the enemy on the left
was finally overthrown, and two thousand men
made prisoners."</p>

<p>After returning from the charge, the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>
resumed their post in position, and were exposed
to a heavy cannonade. In the afternoon the brigade
was moved to its right; and, Colonel Muter having
been wounded, Lieut.-Colonel <span class="smcap">Clifton</span> of the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span> took the command of the three regiments;
when the command of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> devolved on
Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Dorville. The enemy made
several attacks on various points, but was uniformly
repulsed. At length the Duke of Wellington
assumed the offensive. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> again advanced,
and the allied army made a simultaneous
rush upon the enemy, who was overthrown, cut
down, and pursued with dreadful slaughter from
the field of battle. Thus ended a day glorious to
the British arms beyond precedent. The distinguished
services of the <span class="smcap">Heavy Cavalry</span> did not
fail to excite admiration:&mdash;by their powerful attacks
they more than once restored the battle; and they
were especially noticed by the Duke of Wellington
in his despatch.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> had Captain Windsor,
Lieutenant Foster, Cornets Magniac and Sykes,
Adjutant Shepley, six serjeants, eighty-six men,
and one hundred and sixty-one horses killed:
Brevet Major Radclyffe<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>, Captain Clark, Lieutenants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Gunning, Keily, Trafford, Wyndowe,
Ommaney, Blois, and Goodenough, with six serjeants,
eighty-two men, and thirty-five horses,
wounded; also two men wounded and taken prisoners.</p>

<p>On the following morning the allied army
advanced, directing its march upon Paris, which
city was surrendered in the early part of July.
The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> accompanied the army, and on the
7th of July marched into quarters at Nanterre, a
village situate about seven miles from the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
capital. The Bourbon dynasty was restored to
the throne, and the campaign terminated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1816</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> left Nanterre on the 30th of July,
and proceeded to Rouen, and in October to Montevilliers;
from whence they marched, in December,
to the vicinity of the coast; and in the early
part of January, 1816, embarked at Calais. The
regiment landed at Dover and Ramsgate on the
15th of that month, and proceeding from thence
to Ipswich barracks, arrived there on the 23rd;
and, on the 25th, the establishment was reduced
from ten to eight troops. For their distinguished
gallantry on the 18th of June, 1815, permission
was granted for the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> to bear
the word "<span class="smcap">Waterloo</span>" and an "<span class="smcap">Eagle</span>" on
their standards and appointments: every officer
and man present at that engagement received
a silver medal to be worn on the left breast, and
the subaltern officers and soldiers had the privilege
of reckoning two years' service for that day, towards
increase of pay and pension.</p>

<p>The following officers of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>

<div class="sidenote">1817<br />1818</div>

<p>Towards the end of August, 1817, the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> marched for Scotland, and were stationed
at Hamilton, Ayr, Dumfries, Stirling, and
Glasgow. In June, 1818, they embarked at Portpatrick
for Ireland, and, having landed at Donaghadee,
proceeded to Ballinrobe, Sligo, Longford,
Roscommon, and Dunmore. In November a reduction
of eight serjeants, ninety-six men, and
fifty-six horses, was made in the establishment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1819<br />1820</div>

<p>In June, 1819, the regiment proceeded to Dublin,
where it remained on garrison duty until
August of the following year, when it embarked
for England; and, after landing at Liverpool,
marched to Manchester, Oldham, Ashton, and
Altringham.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1821</div>

<p>On the 19th of March, 1821, the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> commenced
their march for Radipole barracks, from
whence a number of parties were detached on
revenue duty; and, for the seizure of smuggled
goods made whilst on this duty, the regiment received
upwards of £200. In September the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
establishment was reduced to six troops, of three
officers, three serjeants, one trumpeter, one farrier,
fifty rank and file, and forty-two horses each.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1822</div>

<p>The regiment marched, on the 13th of June,
1822, from the west and south-west districts, to
Richmond and other villages near the metropolis,
and was reviewed on Wormwood Scrubbs by His
Royal Highness the Duke of York on the 6th of
July. Two days after the review it marched for
Canterbury, detaching troops and parties on the
revenue duty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1823</div>

<p>Having called in the detachments, the regiment
marched from Canterbury, on 1st of July, 1823,
for the cavalry barracks near the Regent's Park,
London, and on their arrival took the King's duty&mdash;the
life guards and royal horse guards having
marched into quarters near Hounslow, preparatory
to a review, which took place on the 15th of
July, when the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> furnished a guard of
honour for His Royal Highness the Duke of York,
and a squadron to assist in keeping the ground.
They were relieved from the King's duty on the
following day, and marched for York barracks,
where they arrived on the 29th of July.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1824</div>

<p>From York the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> marched, on the 24th
of May, 1824, for Scotland, and occupied Piershill
barracks, Edinburgh, and Perth,&mdash;with detachments
at Cupar, Angus, and Forfar; and were
employed, during the calamitous fire in Parliament
Square, Edinburgh, in November, on three successive
days, in preserving order, protecting property,
and rendering assistance to the unfortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
sufferers; and the dismounted men, with the barrack
engine, assisted materially in extinguishing the
fire in the Tron church. The services of the regiment,
on this occasion, were commended in a general
order, issued by the commander of the forces in
Scotland; and in a vote of thanks from the lord provost,
magistrates, and town council of Edinburgh.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1825</div>

<p>In the early part of March, 1825, the regiment
proceeded to Hamilton, and Glasgow, and in the
following month embarked for Ireland; after landing
at Donaghadee, it marched to Dundalk and Belturbet,
from whence several strong escorts were detached
for the safe-conduct of specie,&mdash;the currency
of the two kingdoms having been assimilated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1826<br />1827<br />1828</div>

<p>On the 30th of March, 1826, the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>
marched for Dublin, where they remained until
April, 1827, and then marched for Newbridge;
and in October following proceeded to Cork, Fermoy,
and Bandon. The whole assembled at Cork
in March, 1828, and proceeded from thence to
Ballincollig.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1829</div>

<p>The regiment commenced its march for Dublin
on the 28th of April, 1829, embarked for England
in the early part of May, and, after disembarking
at Liverpool, proceeded into quarters in the town
of Manchester,&mdash;the barracks at that place having
been pulled down for the purpose of being rebuilt.
During their stay at this place the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> furnished
a number of piquets and parties for the prevention
of riot and open violation of the law by
the operatives, who were in a state of disaffection:
detachments were also sent to Blackburn and
Bolton for the same purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>The death of Lieutenant-General Garth having
taken place on the 18th of November, 1829, on
the 23rd of that month, His Majesty conferred
the colonelcy on Lieut.-General Lord R. E. H.
Somerset, G.C.B. from the seventeenth lancers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1830</div>

<p>In the summer of 1830 the regiment marched
to Norwich and Ipswich; at the same time the
establishment was reduced to two hundred and
seventy rank and file. In the autumn of this year
the agricultural labourers, having been excited by
designing men, committed numerous acts of incendiarism
and effected the destruction of property
to a most alarming extent in several counties.
The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> were, in consequence,
called upon to furnish a number of detachments
to assist the civil authorities in suppressing these
outrages. A resolution of thanks from the magistrates
of Norfolk, acknowledging the very effective
services rendered by the officers, non-commissioned
officers, and privates, was forwarded by
the lord-lieutenant of the county, to the general
commanding-in-chief, who was pleased to express
the satisfaction he experienced in being presented
with so honourable a testimonial of their behaviour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1831<br />1832<br />1833<br />1834<br />1835</div>

<p>The regiment remained at Norwich and Ipswich
during the whole of the year 1831. In the
spring of 1832 it marched to Canterbury<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
1833 to Dorchester; and in 1834 to Brighton.
During the following winter it proceeded to Bristol,
from whence it embarked, in January, 1835,
for Ireland; and, after landing at Dublin, was
stationed at Newbridge for sixteen months.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1836</div>

<p>On the removal of Lieutenant-General Lord
Edward Somerset to the fourth dragoons in March,
1836, the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> was conferred
on Major-General Sir Frederick Cavendish Ponsonby,
K.C.B., G.C.M.G., and K.C.H., from the
eighty-sixth foot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1837</div>

<p>During the summer of 1836 the regiment proceeded
to Dublin; and, while stationed at that
place, its colonel, Sir Frederick Cavendish Ponsonby,
died; and was succeeded, on the 20th of
January, 1837, by Lieutenant-General the Right
Honourable Sir Hussey Vivian, K.C.B. and G.C.H.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1838<br />1839</div>

<p>The regiment left Dublin in the autumn of 1837,
and was stationed during the following year at
Cork; from whence it embarked, in May, 1839,
for Liverpool; and, after landing at that port, was
removed to Sheffield, where it has remained until
the conclusion of this memoir.</p>

<p>In taking a retrospective view of the services of
the <span class="smcap">Royal Regiment of Dragoons</span>, its conduct
cannot fail to excite admiration. The details given
in the preceding pages afford numerous instances
of determined bravery, steady discipline, and constant
efficiency. These qualities were eminently
displayed when charging the Moorish legions on
the confines of <em>Africa</em>, and bearing away in triumph
the Mahomedan colours in 1664 and 1680;&mdash;when
routing the insurgent bands at <em>Sedgemoor</em> in
1685;&mdash;forcing the passage of the Boyne in 1690;&mdash;on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
detached services in Ireland in 1691; and opposing
the troops of Louis XIV. in the Netherlands
from 1694 to 1697. Nor were they less conspicuously
evinced when serving on the frontiers of
Holland under the great Duke of Marlborough in
1702 and 1703;&mdash;skirmishing in the mountains of
Catalonia and in the valleys of Valencia, under the
Earl of Peterborough, in 1705 and 1706;&mdash;and
charging the Spanish forces at <em>Almanara</em>, and at
<em>Saragossa</em> in 1710.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> also distinguished themselves
under the eye of their sovereign when fighting
the French cuirassiers at the battle of <em>Dettingen</em>
in 1743, where they captured the standard
of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mousquetaires noirs</i>; they again displayed
signal valour at <em>Warbourg</em> in 1760; and under
the Duke of York in <em>Flanders</em> in 1794. In numerous
fights with the legions of Napoleon in the
<em>Peninsula</em>, from 1810 to 1814, they acquired new
honours: they were also engaged at the glorious
battle of <em>Waterloo</em> on the 18th of June, 1815,
where they captured one of the two French Eagles
taken on that day.</p>

<p>On all occasions the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> have
evinced a dauntless bearing, united with steady
valour, and unshaken firmness, the characteristics
of a British corps. These qualities, as well as the
temper, patience, and forbearance which have distinguished
their conduct, when employed in aiding
the civil power on duties at home, have rendered
the regiment a valuable acquisition to the crown,
and have afforded the strongest proofs of its usefulness

perceived, a little to my left, in the midst of a body of infantry,
an Eagle and Colour, which the bearer was making off with
towards the rear. I immediately gave the order, 'Right shoulders
forward,' to my squadron, at the same time leading direct upon
the Eagle, and calling out to the men with me to 'Secure the
colours.' The instant I got within reach of the officer who
carried the Eagle, I ran my sword into his right side, and he
staggered and fell, but did not reach the ground on account
of the pressure of his companions. As the officer was in the
act of falling, I called out, a second time, to some men close behind me,
'Secure the colour; it belongs to me!' The standard
coverer, Corporal Stiles, and several other men, rushed up, and
the Eagle fell across my horse's head, against that of Corporal
Stiles, who came up on my left. As it was falling I caught
the fringe of the flag with my left hand, but could not at the
first pull up the Eagle: at the second attempt, however, I
succeeded. Being in the midst of French troops, I attempted
to separate the Eagle from the staff, to put it into the breast
of my coatee; but it was too firmly fixed. Corporal Stiles
said, 'Pray, Sir, do not break it!' to which I replied 'Very well;
carry it off to the rear as fast as you can,' which he did. Though
wounded, I preferred remaining in the field in the command of
my squadron, which I did until near seven o'clock in the
evening, when I was obliged to withdraw; having had two
horses killed under me, and having received two wounds, which

Ponsonby), beloved by all who served with or under him, met his
death in a manner which conferred upon it an interesting character.
When the order was given for attacking the enemy, he led the three
regiments forward with that noble ardour for which he had been distinguished
in the campaigns in the Peninsula. Having cut through
the first column, he proceeded where the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were so hotly
engaged, and found himself outflanked by a regiment of Polish
lancers in a newly-ploughed field, the ground of which was so
soft that his horse became blown, and was unable to proceed.
He was attended by only one aide-de-camp. At this instant the
lancers were approaching him at full speed. His own death, he
knew, was inevitable, but supposing his aide-de-camp might
escape, he drew forth the picture of his lady and his watch, and
was in the act of delivering them to his attendant to be conveyed
to his family, when the enemy came up and they were both

taught many of his men his peculiar method of giving point,
and he was afterwards much delighted on being informed that
the troopers, by adhering to his instructions, had been signally
successful in their attacks. The decease of this gallant and
excellent officer, clever man, and good scholar, took place on the
24th of February, 1827: the following is an extract from a
periodical work respecting him:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Died on the 24th of February, 1827, in Connaught-square, Lieutenant-Colonel
Radclyffe, Major of Brigade to the Cavalry in
Great Britain, aged 53.&mdash;This distinguished officer served in all
the campaigns of the late revolutionary war, commencing with
the Duke of York's, in Flanders, in 1793, and ending with the
sanguinary battle of Waterloo. There he received a severe
wound from a musket-ball, which lodged in his knee, the constant
pain and irritation of which (as it could not be extracted) has
thus prematurely destroyed his valuable life. His Lieut.-Colonelcy
took its date from that glorious day. He was present
at the battles of Salamanca, Vittoria, Busaco, Fuentes d'Onor,
the blockade of Pampeluna, and the attack of Bayonne, besides
numerous engagements of minor note. He was Major of Brigade
during the campaigns in Spain to the battle of Toulouse in April,
1814; after which he was appointed Assistant-Adjutant General
to the Cavalry, and accompanied it as such through France to
England. So entirely was his mind devoted to his profession, that
almost the last words he spoke (only two hours before his
death), in answer to a question from his physicians as to how
he felt, were, 'I am retreating, retreating, retreating: I cannot
advance.' He was a most scientific and dexterous swordsman,
a skilful officer, and able tactician. Witness a small work
which he printed on those subjects. He was a sincere and
ardent friend, a conscientious Christian, and a brave and good
man. He lived highly and universally respected, and died
sincerely lamented."</p></div>

<h2 class="large">SUCCESSION OF COLONELS</h2>

<p class="pfs70">OF</p>

<p class="pfs120">THE ROYAL REGIMENT OF DRAGOONS.</p>

<hr class="r30" />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">John Lord Churchill.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 19th November, 1683.</em></p>

<p class="noindent">At its formation the <span class="smcap">Royal Regiment of Dragoons</span>
had the honour of being commanded by one of the most
distinguished officers Great Britain has produced,&mdash;a
general who acquired celebrity in the field and in the
cabinet,&mdash;who never fought a battle he did not win, nor
besiege a town which he did not capture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Churchill</span> was born on the 24th of June, 1650.
At sixteen years of age he was page of honour to the
Duke of York, who procured him an ensign's commission
in the first foot guards; and he soon afterwards resigned
the pleasures of the court to acquire a practical knowledge
of his profession at Tangier, in Africa, where he
served as a volunteer against the Moors, and gave presage
of those bright qualities for which he afterwards
became distinguished. On the breaking out of the Dutch
war in 1672 he was appointed captain in the Duke of
Monmouth's regiment of foot, in the service of the King
of France, with which corps he served in the Netherlands,
where he signalised himself by a regular attention
to his duties, and by volunteering his services on occasions
of difficulty or danger; and he evinced signal gallantry in
1673, at the siege of Maestricht,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> where he was wounded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
He subsequently served with the French army on the
Rhine,&mdash;attracted the particular attention and regard of
the celebrated Marshal Turenne,&mdash;and in 1674 he was
appointed colonel of one of the English regiments in the
service of the French monarch, in succession to the Earl
of Peterborough. His regiment was recalled from France
in 1678, and he was appointed to the command of a
brigade of foot in Flanders; but the peace of Nimeguen
taking place, he returned to England, and his regiment
was disbanded. He became the constant attendant of
the Duke of York, and being employed in several delicate
missions between His Royal Highness and the King, he
evinced great address.</p>

<p>The King having resolved to add to the regular army
a regiment of dragoons for permanent service, Colonel
Churchill was commissioned to raise a troop of dragoons,
and was appointed colonel of the regiment, which was
honoured with the distinguished title of the <span class="smcap">Royal
Regiment of Dragoons</span>. He was also advanced to the
peerage of Scotland by the title of Baron Churchill of
Aymouth. Soon after the accession of King James II.
he was created an English peer by the title of Baron
Churchill of Sandridge. On the 14th of May, 1685, he
was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general: on the
breaking out of the rebellion of the Duke of Monmouth
he was sent, with a body of cavalry, to the west of England,
and he was second in command at the battle of
Sedgemoor. His meritorious conduct during this rebellion
was rewarded with the colonelcy of the third troop
of life guards, and the rank of major-general. No ties of
interest, or charms of royal favour, could, however, induce
him to abandon the best interests of his native
country; and at the Revolution in 1688 he joined the
standard of the Prince of Orange, for which he was
removed from the life guards by King James. On the
accession of King William III. he was restored to the
command of the third troop of life guards,&mdash;appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
colonel of the royal fusiliers,&mdash;sworn a member of the
privy council,&mdash;made lord of the bedchamber to his Majesty,&mdash;created
<span class="smcap">Earl of Marlborough</span>, and appointed
to the command of the British troops sent to the Netherlands,
to be employed in the war with France. During
the campaign of 1689 he served under Prince Waldeck,
and gave proof of his personal bravery, and ability to
command, at the battle of Walcourt. In June, 1690, he
was appointed commander-in-chief, and proceeding, in
the autumn of that year, with a body of troops to Ireland,
captured Cork and Kinsale. In 1691 he commanded
the British infantry under King William in the Netherlands.
In the following year he was confined in the
Tower of London on a charge of high treason; but was
subsequently released without being brought to trial, and
restored to royal favour. On the breaking out of the
war in 1701, he was selected by King William to command
the British forces sent to the Netherlands, and to
negotiate the treaties to be formed with foreign powers;
and he was appointed colonel of a regiment of foot (now
twenty-fourth). Queen Anne confirmed these appointments;
also advanced him to the post of captain-general
of her forces, and procured him the chief command of the
united British, Dutch, and auxiliary troops. At the head of
these forces he evinced the abilities of a great captain;
he forced the enemy to take shelter behind their lines;
took Venloo, Ruremonde, Stevenswaert, and Liege with
surprising rapidity; extended and secured the Dutch
frontiers; and was rewarded with the thanks of parliament,
the approbation of his sovereign, and the dignity of
<span class="smcap">Duke of Marlborough</span>. In the campaign of 1703 he
was again victorious; he captured Bonn, Huy, and Limburg;
but his career of victory was impeded by the
jealousy or timidity of the Dutch, which he bore in a
manner corresponding with the greatness of his mind.
On the 25th of April, 1704, he was appointed colonel
of the first foot guards. The succeeding campaign
was splendid in glorious achievements. He led his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
army from the ocean to the Danube; forced the
heights of Schellenberg on the 2nd July, 1704, and
compelled the enemy to take shelter behind the lines of
Augsburg. New armies and new generals appeared, and
their overthrow, at the decisive battle of Blenheim on the
13th of August, added new lustre to the reputation of the
British commander: there the heaps of slain gave dreadful
proofs of British valour, and whole legions of prisoners
of their mercy. This victory displayed the distinguishing
character of <span class="smcap">Marlborough</span>, and produced important
results: Bavaria was subdued; Ratisbon, Augsburg,
Ulm, Meninghen,&mdash;all were recovered. From the Danube
he marched to the Rhine and the Moselle; Landau,
Treves, and Traerbach were taken; and the British commander,&mdash;courted
and honoured by sovereign princes,&mdash;applauded
by nations, became the pride of armies, and
was rewarded with the dignity of a <span class="smcap">Prince of the Roman
Empire</span>. While his judgment swayed the councils
of the states of Christendom, he led their armies to battle
and victory. In 1705 he experienced disappointment
from the princes he had delivered in the preceding year;
but, suddenly changing the scene of his operations, he led
his army from the Moselle to the Maese; Liege was
relieved; Huy retaken; and the boasted impregnable
French lines forced. In the spring of 1706 another
campaign opened, when the discipline he had introduced,
and the confidence he had inspired, again proved invincible.
He met, attacked, and triumphed over the French,
Spaniards, and Bavarians, at Ramilies, on the 23rd of
May. This decisive action was followed by the surrender
of Louvain, Brussels, Malines, Liege, Ghent, Oudenarde,
Antwerp, Damme, Bruges, and Courtray; and by the capture
of Ostend, Menin, Dendermond, and Aeth,&mdash;places
which had resisted the greatest generals for months&mdash;for
years; provinces, disputed for ages, were the conquests
of a summer. So great was his reputation, that, throughout
the campaign of 1707, the enemy avoided a general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
engagement: but in the following summer a gallant
French army, led by the princes of the blood, was overcome
at Oudenarde; and, although new armies and new
generals appeared, the career of Marlborough could not
be stopped. The barriers of France on the side of the
Low Countries,&mdash;the work of half a century,&mdash;were attacked.
A numerous French army were spectators of
the fall of Lisle, the bulwark of their barriers. Every
campaign added new conquests. In 1709 Tournay was
taken; and a powerful French army posted near Malplaquet,
in a position covered by thick woods, defended
by triple intrenchments, was attacked. The battle was
bloody,&mdash;the event decisive; the woods were pierced; the
fortifications were trampled down; and the enemy fled.
After this victory Mons was taken. In the succeeding
year Douay, Bethune, Aire, St. Venant, shared the same
fate; and the campaign of 1711 was distinguished by
splendid success. A new series of lines were passed, and
Bouchain captured. Nothing availed against a general
whose sagacity foresaw everything, whose vigilance attended
to everything, whose constancy no labour could
subdue, whose courage no danger could dismay, and
whose intuitive glance always caught the decisive moment
and insured victory; while the discipline he maintained,
and the confidence he inspired, were equivalent to an
army. The French monarch saw with alarm his generals
overmatched, his armies beaten and discouraged, his
fortresses wrested from him, and an invincible leader with
a victorious army on the confines of France, ready to
carry all the horrors of war into the heart of his kingdom,
and he sued for peace. A change of the ministry in
England, with the adoption of a policy favourable to the
French interest, was followed by the removal of the great
<span class="smcap">Marlborough</span> from all his offices dependent on the
British crown. He retired to the Continent, where he
remained until the accession of King George I., when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
was replaced in his former posts, in which he continued
until his decease in 1722.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Edward Viscount Cornbury.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 1st August, 1685.</em></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Edward Hyde Viscount Cornbury</span>, son of the second
Earl of Clarendon, was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the
<span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> when that corps was first embodied;
and having distinguished himself at the battle of Sedgemoor,
he succeeded Lord Churchill in the colonelcy of
the regiment. The circumstances of his removal are
stated at <a href="#Page_19">page 19</a> in the 'Historical Record of the Royal
Dragoons.'</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Robert Clifford.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 24th November, 1688.</em></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Major Robert Clifford</span> of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> was
firmly devoted to the Roman Catholic interest, and in
November, 1688, by his exertions he recovered the regiment
for the service of King James, as stated at <a href="#Page_19">page 19</a> in
the Historical Record of the corps. At the revolution he
adhered to King James, and he commanded a corps of
dragoons in Ireland, until the siege of Limerick in 1691,
when he was imprisoned by the Irish on a charge of
favouring the passage of the Shannon by the English;
and would have been condemned to death, if the town
had not surrendered soon afterwards.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Edward Viscount Cornbury.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Re-appointed 31st December, 1688.</em></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Lord Cornbury</span> was restored to the colonelcy of the
<span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> by the Prince of Orange; but was
removed from his command a few months afterwards.
He was governor of New York, in the reign of Queen
Anne; and in October, 1709, succeeded to the title of
<span class="smcap">Earl of Clarendon</span>. His decease occurred on the
31st of March, 1723.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Anthony Hayford.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 1st July, 1689.</em></p>

<p class="noindent">This Officer served in the life guards as a private gentleman,
and afterwards in the Duke of Monmouth's regiment
of horse in the reign of Charles II. In 1684 he was
appointed lieutenant in the horse grenadier guards. In
1687 he was lieutenant-colonel of the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>.
He joined the Prince of Orange in November, 1688; and
succeeding Lord Cornbury in the colonelcy of the regiment
in 1689, served in Scotland and Ireland.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Edward Matthews.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed in June, 1690.</em></p>

<p class="noindent">This Officer served as a volunteer at Tangier, in
Africa; also in Ireland in 1690 and the following year,
and distinguished himself on several occasions. He
also commanded a brigade of dragoons under King
William in Flanders, in 1694, 1695, and 1696; and died
on the 28th of May, 1697.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Thomas Lord Raby.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 30th May, 1697.</em></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Thomas Wentworth</span>, son of Sir William Wentworth,
baronet, was appointed cornet of the fourth horse, now
third dragoon guards, on the 31st of December, 1688;
and in the following summer served with his regiment
against the rebel Highlanders in Scotland. In 1692
he served in Flanders, and was in the advance-guard at the
battle of Steenkirk on the 3rd of August in that year,
where he highly distinguished himself, and the squadron
he was with, being exposed to a heavy cannonade, only
brought off fifty men alive out of one hundred and fifty.
His gallantry on this occasion was especially reported to
his sovereign, and he was appointed aide-de-camp to
His Majesty: in which capacity he served at the battle
of Landen, on the 19th of July, 1693, when his conduct
obtained the approbation of King William III., who promoted
him to the commission of cornet and major in the
first troop, now first regiment, of life guards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Major Wentworth served with the life guards in the
subsequent campaigns in the Netherlands, and rose to
the rank of lieutenant, and lieutenant-colonel. He succeeded,
on the decease of William Earl of Strafford, to
the title of <span class="smcap">Lord Raby</span>; was appointed colonel of the
<span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span> in May, 1697; and attended the Earl
of Portland in the interviews with Marshal Boufflers,
which preceded the conclusion of peace at Ryswick. In
1698 his lordship accompanied King William to Holland,
and, on one occasion, when hunting with His
Majesty, he went alone and attacked a wild boar; the
animal, however, threw him down, and had already torn
his clothes and lacerated his flesh, when the King sent
two huntsmen to his aid, who speared the boar.</p>

<p>In the first year of the reign of Queen Anne, Lord
Raby served with his regiment on the Continent, and in
January, 1703, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general.
In the spring of the same year he was appointed
envoy extraordinary to the King of Prussia, and
subsequently ambassador extraordinary at the same
court; and on the first of January, 1705, was advanced
to the rank of major-general. His lordship served in
the army under the Duke of Marlborough, during the
brilliant campaign of 1706; and, on the 1st of January
following, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general.
In 1711 he was sworn of the privy council,
and appointed ambassador extraordinary to the States-General
of Holland; and in September of the same
year he was advanced to the dignity of <span class="smcap">Earl of Strafford</span>.
His Lordship took an active part in negociating
the treaty of peace at Utrecht; but after the accession
of George I., he was removed from his public
employments. The Earl of Strafford died on the 15th of
November, 1739.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Richard Lord Cobham.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 13th June, 1715.</em></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Sir Richard Temple</span> served under King William in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the Netherlands; and, on the breaking out of the war of
the Spanish succession, he was promoted to the colonelcy
of a newly-raised regiment of foot, which was disbanded
at the peace of Utrecht. He served under the great
Duke of Marlborough, and was conspicuous for a noble
bearing, a greatness of soul, and a contempt of danger,
which he exhibited in a signal manner at the sieges of
Venloo and Ruremonde, at the battle of Oudenarde, and
at the siege of the important fortress of Lisle. In
January, 1709, he was promoted to the rank of major-general,
and his conduct at the siege of Tournay, the
sanguinary battle of Malplaquet, and siege of Mons, was
rewarded, in the following year, with the rank of lieutenant-general
and the colonelcy of the fourth dragoons.
He served under the Duke of Marlborough in 1711, and
had the honour of taking part in the forcing of the
French lines at Arleux, and the capture of the strong
fortress of Bouchain. After the change in the ministry,
and the adoption of a new system of policy by the court,
the well-known attachment of this officer to the Protestant
succession, occasioned him to be removed from
his regiment; but on the accession of King George I. he
was elevated to the peerage by the title of <span class="smcap">Baron of
Cobham</span>, and in 1715 he was appointed colonel of the
<span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>. In 1717 he was appointed governor
of Windsor Castle; in 1718 he was advanced to the
dignity of <span class="smcap">Viscount Cobham</span>; and in 1721 he was removed
to the King's horse, now first dragoon guards.
He was also one of the privy council, and governor of
the island of Jersey; but resigned his appointments in
1733. On the change of the ministry in 1742 he was
promoted to the rank of field-marshal, and in December
of the same year King George II. conferred upon him
the colonelcy of the first troop of horse grenadier guards.
In 1744 he was removed to the sixth horse, and in 1745
to the tenth dragoons, the colonelcy of which corps he
retained until his decease in 1749.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Charles Hotham</span>, eldest son of the Rev. Charles
Hotham, Rector of Wigan, succeeded to the dignity of
baronet on the decease of his uncle in 1691. He served
with distinction in the wars of King William III., and
also under the great Duke of Marlborough in the reign
of Queen Anne; and in 1705 he obtained the colonelcy
of a regiment of foot, with which he proceeded to Spain
in 1706, and was in garrison at Alicant when the unfortunate
battle of Almanza was fought. Sir Charles
served with reputation during the remainder of the war;
but his regiment, having suffered severely in the defence
of several fortified towns, was disbanded in Catalonia
in 1708. He was appointed brigadier-general in 1710;
and shortly after the accession of King George I., he
was commissioned to raise a regiment of foot, which,
after the suppression of the rebellion of the Earl of Mar,
was sent to Ireland, and disbanded in the following year,
when Sir Charles was appointed colonel of a newly-raised
regiment of dragoons, which was, however, disbanded
in November, 1718.</p>

<p>On the 7th of July, 1719, the colonelcy of the thirty-sixth
regiment of foot was conferred on Sir Charles
Hotham; he was removed to the eighth foot in December
1720; and in April following to the <span class="smcap">Royal Dragoons</span>.
His decease occurred on the 8th of January, 1723.</p>

to the lieutenant-colonelcy of the regiment. In 1811 he
served under lieutenant-general Graham at Cadiz; and
at the battle of Barossa, in March of that year, he
attacked, with a squadron of German dragoons, the
French cavalry covering the retreat, overthrew them,
took two guns, and even attempted, though vainly, to
sabre Rousseau's battalions. On the 11th of June, 1811,
he was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the twelfth light
dragoons; at the head of which corps he served under Lord
Wellington, and distinguished himself, in April, 1812, at
Llerena, in one of the most brilliant cavalry actions
during the war. At the battle of Salamanca he charged
the French infantry, broke his sword in the fight, and his
horse received several bayonet wounds. He repeatedly
evinced great judgment, penetration, and resolution in
out-post duty, and was wounded in the retreat from
Burgos, on the 13th of October, 1812. At the battle of
Vittoria he again distinguished himself: his services at
Tolosa, St. Sebastian, and Nive were also conspicuous;
and, on the king's birth-day in 1814, he was promoted to
the rank of colonel in the army. He commanded the
twelfth light dragoons at the battle of Waterloo, where
he led his regiment to the charge with signal intrepidity,&mdash;received
sabre cuts on both arms,&mdash;was brought to the
ground by a blow on the head,&mdash;pierced through the
back by a lancer,&mdash;plundered by a tirailleur,&mdash;ridden over
by two squadrons of cavalry,&mdash;and plundered a second

his wounds. His services were rewarded with the following

order of the Bath,&mdash;Knight grand cross of the order of
St. Michael and St. George,&mdash;Knight commander of the
Hanoverian Guelphic order,&mdash;a cross,&mdash;a Waterloo
medal,&mdash;Knight of the Tower and Sword of Portugal,&mdash;and

the staff of those islands on the 4th of March, 1824; and
in June, 1825, he was advanced to the rank of major-general: he
was removed to the staff at Malta, and retained
the command of the troops in that island until May,
1835. In 1835 he obtained the colonelcy of the eighty-sixth
regiment, from which he was removed to the <span class="smcap">Royal
Dragoons</span> in the following year. He was an ornament
to his profession. In him, military talent was united

decision,&mdash;resolute action,&mdash;and modest deportment.
He died on the 10th of January, 1837.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
